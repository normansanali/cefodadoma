We shall discuss five such potent weapons in this article.</p><h2>Five of the most powerful DC weapons of all time.</h2><h2>1) The Trident of Neptune</h2><p>The Trident of Neptune, part of The Seven Treasures of Atlantis, is one of the most formidable weapons in the DC world. It gives its possessor complete power over the ocean and its inhabitants.</p><p>The trident also grants its bearer magical healing abilities, teleportation, weather control, and the ability to manipulate Atlantean technologies. The trident has recently been seen in a number of DC films, where it is possessed by Aquaman.</p><h2>2) Lasso of Truth</h2><p>Another formidable weapon from DC Comics is the Lasso of Truth, sometimes known as the Golden Perfect or the Lasso of Hestia. It is estimated to be 150 meters long and is possessed by Wonder Woman, aka Diana Prince, the legendary demi-god.</p><p>The Lasso is unbreakable and has the ability to cast hypnosis, resurrect memories, and erase illusions. Last but not least, it has the ability to force someone, to tell the truth.</p><h2>3) Kryptonite Ring</h2><p>The Kryptonite Ring, if you were wondering whether there was anything that could outshine the Mighty Superman, is the answer. The ring, which is formed of Kryptonite, may be used to keep any Kryptonian away.</p><p>It was an important element of Batman’s arsenal in various circumstances. The ring produces rays that weaken and, in extreme cases, kill Kryptonian individuals with unrivaled superpowers.</p><h2>4) God Killer</h2><p>The God Killer, a mythological and incredibly deadly sword from the DC universe, is the final item on our list. The blade, which was forged by the god Hephaestus for Deathstroke, has the capacity to change forms and provide its user with superhuman abilities. Khaji Da, Atomic Axe, Spear Of Destiny, and more deadly weapons are worth mentioning.</p><h2>5) Antimatter Cannon</h2><p>The Antimatter Cannon is the only weapon capable of destroying the whole universe. Several times during the Crisis on Infinite Earths series, Antimatter planned to deploy the weapon to wipe out the remaining five universes.</p><p>Things didn’t proceed as planned, however, as Barry Allen, dubbed The Flash, interfered to destroy the canon, but in the process, he died.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiroZ1dqbyxecWirZ5lnaTAtXnPqKuepqRisaR51p6YqaeeqHqwsoyao6VlpJ66pns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
