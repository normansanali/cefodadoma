Because Swift does not do meet and greets “before or after the show,” he was unable to<a href=#> ask her on a date</a>. “I was a little butthurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her … I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my [phone] number on it,” he said at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6muurjOq2Ssr5mbwW7DxJqprGWalrCssdNmnaunnWKys7XNZpinnKKaxLR5y6KlnmWRqXqktMienaxll5a6pns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
