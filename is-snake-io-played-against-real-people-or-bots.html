The game draws inspiration from the popular multiplayer game Agar.io, which uses similar mechanics, and the classic arcade game Snake. As Slither.io grew in popularity over the years, many rip-off titles were created, including the equally as famous <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snake.io</a></strong>, which isn’t the most subtle copycat.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=525 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>The objective of Slither.io is to grow the longest snake in the server and hold the top spot for as long as possible. These mechanics transfer over to Snake.io as well, except there’s one major difference. Slither.io opponents are real people, logging in simultaneously to grow their snakes and become the champion. As for Snake.io, gamers will be extremely disappointed to find out that they’re playing against bots, so it’s essentially a free-for-all between yourself, a living person, and a bunch of AI.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>And hear us out, there’s a dead giveaway that Snake.io uses bots. For starters, it’s ridiculously easy to climb the leaderboard, whereas actual players would be far more experienced so the competition would be stiffer. As far as cheating, if you can consider AI cheating, both Slither.io and Snake.io are home to cheaters. There’s truly no escaping them, really, as any game can be hacked.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Just take a look at a leaderboard taken from a Slither.io server. First of all, the scores jump drastically from 89,890,335 to 999,999,999, which is simply unrealistic. Secondly, it’s highly unlikely for two players to have exactly 999,999,999 points at the same time without manipulating the game in some way to give themselves that score.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Slither.io-Scoreboard.jpg><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>Although we hate to break it to you, Snake.io is first and foremost a rip-off, so any in-game mechanics shared with Slither.io will also be rip-offs, including the actual opponents being bots. In hindsight, Kooapps Games, the developers of Snake.io, knew that they’d never be able to compete with the popularity of Slither.io, so introducing real people would have likely amounted to nothing.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=false>That being said, both Slither.io and Snake.io are available to download in the Apple Store, Google Play Store, or accessible via an internet browser, so take your pick.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZooKxlo6OurLGMoqZmqJyWxqawjJqemqGeqMFuvsSao2aolaS9rbGMqKlmmp%2BpwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
