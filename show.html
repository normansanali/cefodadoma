We’ve also condensed this assembly process down to a brief summary, however.<p>Essentially, the assembly of the desk boils down to three stages: attaching the legs, attaching the other parts of the main desk unit, and then once turned right side up again, the additional units such as the side desk and printer stand can be tacked on. Here’s a shot right after the legs are attached. Note that if we had done it all over again, we would have attached more pieces to the main top before turning it over, but we did not actually have a copy of assembly instructions included with our unit, since it is a preview model.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/cases/lianli/desk/39-desk1_small.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><br>Click to enlarge.</p>After attaching the additional parts to the main top, such as the backing plate and case holder, we connected the side desk and printer stand. Everything fits together extremely solidly, and the provided screwdriver will certainly be used here for many years to come.<p align=center><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/cases/lianli/desk/61-side_desk5_small.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><br>Click to enlarge.</p>Speaking of the supplied screwdriver though, the entire collection of supplied tools is pretty decent, but the very long-necked Allen key and screwdriver definitely stand out from the rest as tools that will be particularly useful even after the assembly is finished. Also included in the downloadable image pack is this shot of all the supplied tools and fastening hardware.<p align=center><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/cases/lianli/desk/35-tools1_small.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><br>Click to enlarge.</p>After putting the entire desk together, we wondered if it was possible to also attach the side desk to the other side, just like the printer stand. It sure is, but while we were doing so, we noticed something far more interesting in our opinion.<p><strong>Everything</strong> is reversible!</p><p>Yes, you read right… from the multimedia port to the case holder unit itself, the entire desk can be flipped left-to-right. This is probably the single most useful aspect of this desk, as it will allow people to configure it exactly how it will fit their needs best. Unfortunately, we cannot comment for sure on whether or not the F2 models allow for this too, but we see no reason why they would not. Just to be sure, as soon as we had finished assembly, we took the thing practically back to the beginning and reconfigured it.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/cases/lianli/desk/69-reverse1_small.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><br>Click to enlarge.</p>This is also our best shot of the entire desk with all supplied accessories attached that we managed to get.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH54gY9obw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
