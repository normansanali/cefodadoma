It’s a raw, unfiltered look at the lives of four young women living in New York City. Lena’s unflinchingly honest portrayal of women in their twenties was a welcome change for most television audiences—<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hence her meteoric rise</a>! However, although Lena became incredibly successful at an early age, she has struggled with self-esteem issues for quite some time; she also hasn’t publicly dated all that much. Therefore, it was very exciting to see her with former Fun. drummer, Jack Antonoff. The two were an indie couple made in heaven, and everyone loved their sweet, quirky romance. It was also a breath of fresh air to see Lena find love with a cool musician.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, the sparks didn’t last between these two; they split after six years. The following list details their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">heartbreaking separation</a>.</p><h2 id=blind-date><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Blind Date</span></h2><p>Jack Antonoff and Lena Dunham met on a blind date set up by a friend—comedian Mike Birbiglia. They had a fabulous dinner date and shared an instant connection. Jack immediately opened up to Lena because he wanted her to know everything about him. Mike definitely made a great match!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meghan Markle And Prince Harry Plus Other Celebrities Who Met On A Blind Date</a></span></p><h2 id=no-more-solitude><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>No More Solitude</span></h2><p>Although most people use relationships as a means to avoid solitude, Lena began to miss hers. Living with Jack, Lena began to feel disconnected from her own internal dialogue. Therefore, she started taking more baths; they allowed her to truly be alone and ponder to herself. She just needed space.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bye-brooklyn><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Bye Brooklyn</span></h2><p>When Lena and Jack officially called it quits, Jack stayed in their Brooklyn apartment while Lena headed out. She actually bought an apartment that she never stayed in! Lena would hop from friends’ houses, to hotel rooms, to even her dad’s office. She eventually sold the apartment at a loss.</p><h2 id=lorde-after-lena><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Lorde After Lena?</span></h2><p>Rumors swirled that Jack Antonoff dated Lorde immediately after he and Lena broke up. Jack and Lorde vehemently denied anything happened between the two of them. Lena stated that all she can do is believe what Jack says; she also divulged that she and Lorde haven’t spoken since the breakup.</p><h2 id=big-dreams><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Big Dreams</span></h2><p>When they were living together, Jack and Lena planned to get married and have kids in their Brooklyn apartment. It was supposed to be their starter home, in a sense. These goals made their breakup that much worse; they were obviously planning to spend the rest of their lives together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rebound-disaster><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Rebound Disaster</span></h2><p>After her breakup with Jack, Lena actually had an extreme rebound! Someone Lena was seeing, who remains anonymous to this day, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">proposed to her with a shoelace</a> and she said “yes.” The engagement didn’t last long, as Lena realized she wasn’t in the right frame of mind to be dating.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lopez And Ben Affleck Plus Other Celebs You Forgot Were Engaged At Some Point</a></span></p><h2 id=disappointing-decor><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Disappointing Decor</span></h2><p>When Jack and Lena moved into their Brooklyn apartment, together, Lena decided to decorate the space while Jack was away on tour. When he returned, Lena could tell he was disappointed. Whereas Jack is simple and refined, Lena is bold and colorful. Their different aesthetic tastes actually caused much tension.</p><h2 id=he-stood-by-her><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Stood By Her</span></h2><p>Although Jack and Lena didn’t last, their relationship was filled with touching moments. For instance, Jack spent his New Year’s Eve night at a hospital, holding Lena’s hand, while she got an enema. Most people wouldn’t want to make such a sacrifice. However, Jack knew his place was with Lena.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=normal-looking-girl><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>"Normal-Looking" Girl</span></h2><p>After Lena, Jack moved on with artist and model Carlotta Kohl. Lena was disappointed to see Jack with a “normal-looking” girl (i.e., how girls are supposed to look). Lena has always known she doesn’t fit the usual standards of beauty, so seeing Jack with someone who does was especially painful.</p><h2 id=lamby><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lamby</span></h2><p>Jack and Lena rescued a dog named Lamby while they were together. He’s so cute, he even had his own Instagram! Unfortunately, Lamby had aggression issues, so they eventually had to give him up. Their giving him up was quite unfortunate, but it probably made the breakup a little easier.</p><h2 id=potential-baby-names><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Potential Baby Names</span></h2><p>Jack and Lena were so serious about each other, they actually created a list of potential baby names! Apparently, they were having a silly time in bed and listed their favorites. Gracious, Carrot, and Na were just three of many options. Their kid would’ve been just as cool as them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-inspired-taylor><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Inspired Taylor!</span></h2><p>Jack was a drummer for Fun., but now he works with Taylor Swift! The two constantly collaborate and make music together. When Taylor met Lena, they had a long conversation about relationships, and Jack’s and Lena’s love actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">inspired Taylor to write</a>&nbsp;“You Are In Love” for her 1989 album.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facts About Taylor Swift's 2014 Album, 1989</a></span></p><h2 id=they-gave-each-other-space><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They Gave Each Other Space</span></h2><p>Although Lena missed her alone time during the relationship, Jack claims he and Lena gave each other space, artistically. Essentially, the two refrained from commenting on the other’s work to keep from influencing each other too much. They’d share opinions from time to time, but they’d choose their words carefully.</p><h2 id=cat-lady><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Cat Lady</span></h2><p>Lena adores cats; however, she never adopted any because Jack absolutely hates them. After the breakup, Lena acquired three hairless Sphinx cats. She loves the way they look, saying their baldness makes them more interesting to look at. She treats her kitties like queens and posts their pictures on Instagram!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=loyal-jack><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Loyal Jack</span></h2><p>Jack and Lena may be broken up, but they remain fairly friendly nowadays. Lena’s only had great things to say about her former boyfriend. She even commended Jack’s loyalty during an interview, saying they probably lasted much longer than they should’ve because Jack refuses to abandon the people he loves.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tana Mongeau And Brad Sousa: 15 Facts About Their Relationship (And Breakup)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irsGptc2gZLCdXaC7sMOMmpmoraRiuaa6wGabrqaYlrpurc2dZKOZk6B6orrTqKWonpaoerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
