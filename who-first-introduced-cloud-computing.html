In 1983, CompuServe offered its consumer users a small amount of disk space that could be used to store any files they chose to upload.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-company-first-introduced-cloud-computing></span>Which company first introduced cloud computing?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>On August 25, 2006, <b>Amazon Web Services</b> launched Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), enabling people to rent virtual computers and use their own programs and applications online; this was quickly followed by Google Docs Services.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-the-father-of-cloud-computing></span>Who is the father of cloud computing?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>J.C.R. Licklider Who is the father of cloud computing technology? The answer to this trivia night question is <b>American computer scientist J.C.R.</b><b>Licklider</b>. In the late 1960s, he envisioned a world where everyone would be connected with the ability to access specific programs and data regardless of where the access point was located.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-cloud-is-called-cloud></span>Why cloud is called cloud?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Cloud computing is named as such because <b>the information being accessed is found remotely in the cloud or a virtual space</b>. Companies that provide cloud services enable users to store files and applications on remote servers and then access all the data via the Internet. … Cloud computing can be both public and private.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-owns-cloud-computing></span>Who owns cloud computing?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The short answer is that <b>you own the data you create</b>, but the cloud service provider has ultimate control over it. This is reflected in many providers’ terms of service which state that they can hold on to the data to comply with legal regulations.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=when-did-cloud-computing-start-in-india></span>When did cloud computing start in India?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In <b>2008</b>, IBM opened a cloud center in Bangalore for mid-market vendors, universities, government bodies, and microfinance and telecommunications companies.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-invented-clouds-in-the-sky></span>Who invented clouds in the sky?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Luke Howard Jr.</b> Luke Howard, FRS (28 November 1772 – 21 March 1864) was a British manufacturing chemist and an amateur meteorologist with broad interests in science.
