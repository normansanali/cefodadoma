1. I love airplanes. Growing up on Air Force bases, I certainly had the “bug,” but I never earned my pilot’s license. Instead, I fly flight simulators on my computer."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Growing up on Air Force bases, I certainly had the “bug,” but I never earned my pilot’s license. Instead, I fly flight simulators on my computer.</p><p>2. As a high school senior, I testified before a committee of the California legislature in support of a bill that would have allowed 17-year-olds to register to vote.</p><p>3. In 1979, I was rejected for a job at NBC’s flagship radio station, WNBC. I got a letter saying I wasn’t what they were looking for. I still smile every time I look at it.</p><p>4. I wouldn’t ask out my now-wife until her roommate assured me she’d say yes.</p><p>5. I have a fear of snakes.</p><p>6. A juror instruction video I recorded in the mid-’90s still plays in Chicago’s Cook County Court.</p><p>7. I could eat Mexican food every day.</p><span class=caption></span><p>8. I like scary movies. Among my favorites: The Hills Have Eyes and 2005’s The Descent.</p><p>9. Shortly before I left Chicago to join MSNBC, I shaved off the mustache I had for my whole TV career following a lousy day of skiing and a couple of beers.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/diets-cover-zoom-4eb6fba2-66bf-4c8b-94e8-6731d1d11889.jpg alt width=1000 height=1354 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>10. I lived in Alaska from when I was 8 until I was 12 because my father was stationed at Anchorage’s Elmendorf Air Force Base.</p><p>11. I used to be the lead singer in church.</p><p>12. I recorded two songs on the soundtrack for the medical series House with the celebrity group Band From TV.</p><p>13. Running with the bulls in Spain used to be on my bucket list until maturity and the responsibility of my role at NBC won out.</p><p>14. The only assignment I ever refused required me to parachute out of a plane with the interview subject.</p><p>15. While I’m based in New York, I maintain an apartment in the L.A. area and often anchor NBC Nightly News from our L.A. studio.</p><p>16. I have not owned a car in nearly 10 years.</p><p>17. I like to bake desserts, especially cobblers and pies. I’ll take a tart over a chocolate soufflé any day.</p><p>18. I speak a little Italian.</p><span class=caption></span><p>19. I’m dangerous when it comes to mechanical things. I once installed a garage shelf that then collapsed, sending buckets of paint falling onto our babysitter’s car.</p><p>20. I’m a morning person.</p><p>21. I always have to have the latest device. I travel with two phones, an iPad, a laptop and an Apple Watch.</p><p>22. I dabbled in stand-up comedy.</p><p>23. People are often surprised I don’t golf.</p><p>24. I only attended college for two years, but I have two honorary doctorate degrees from Pepperdine University and California State University, Sacramento.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25.
