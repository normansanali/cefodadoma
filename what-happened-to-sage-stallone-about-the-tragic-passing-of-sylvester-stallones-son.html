So, what happened?</p><h2 id=h-who-was-sage-stallone data-injectable=false>Who was Sage Stallone?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-117932185.jpg><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>Sage Moonblood Stallone was born in 1976 to Sylvester Stallone and Sasha Cazck and went on to study film-making at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts. Sage appeared alongside his father in Rocky V, where he played Robert Balboa Jr, Rocky’s son. He would also appear in Stallone’s 1996 disaster movie Daylight, as well as horror movies Chaos, Moscow Zero and The Manson Family.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Sage would go on to become a director, making his debut with 2006 short film Vic, for which he won the 2006 Boston Film Festival’s “Best New Filmmaker” award, as well as work in film preservation with a focus on grindhouse/exploitation movies: “dedicated to the restoration and preservation of motion pictures historically held in very low regard.”</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>In 2007 he married Starlin Wright, but the marriage was annulled in 2008 for unknown reasons. There are reports he was engaged to be married once again at the time of this death, but we don’t know to whom.</p><h2 id=h-sage-stallone-s-death data-injectable=false>Sage Stallone’s death</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/chrome_Ik2dy6FOU1.jpg><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>In July 2012, Sage went missing for four days, and on July 13 he was found dead by his housekeeper in his home in Studio City, Los Angeles. Drug use was suspected and the Los Angeles County Coroner investigated, though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed that the cause of death was atherosclerosis</a>, a condition that causes narrowed arteries and which brought on the heart attack that killed him.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>No illegal drugs were found in Sage’s body, with the only substance found in his blood “an over-the-counter Tylenol-style pain medication”. Despite this, tabloid gossip ran rampant about illegal drug use being a factor in Sage’s death, causing Stallone to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">make an emotional public plea</a>:</p><p>“This is in reference to the speculation and questionable reporting surrounding the death of my son Sage. Because when a parent loses a child there is no greater pain. Therefore I am imploring people to respect my wonderfully talented son’s memory and feel compassion for his loving mother Sasha, because this agonizing loss will be felt for the rest of our lives. Sage was our first child and the center of our universe and I am humbly begging for all to have my son’s memory and soul left in peace.”</p><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=158 data-injectable=false>Sage’s funeral took place on July 21 at St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church in Los Angeles and he was buried in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGK1orzPnqWenF2pvG6%2FwKCcZquklrmtu82eZJqan6rBbsDHnmStqpGctqR5z5qqrKGenHqwsoyssKWulajBpr6MrKuapJyku6a%2FjKymp2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
