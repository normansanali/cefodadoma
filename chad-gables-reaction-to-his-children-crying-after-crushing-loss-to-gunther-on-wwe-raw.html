Chad Gable and Gunther have faced off thrice so far, with Gables even handing GUNTHER his first loss on the main roster via count-out last month."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Gunther put his title on the line again on this week’s episode of Monday Night RAW.</p><p>Chad Gable almost had it won towards the end, but GUNTHER caught a second win and used a deadly combination of moves to put away Gable and crush his dreams and even made Gable’s daughter cry.</p><p>While speaking during a <a href=#>WWE RAW Exclusive</a>, Gable shared his thoughts after his&nbsp;crushing defeat to GUNTHER and addressed his children crying during WWE RAW this week.</p><p>“It’s one of those things where amateur wrestling taught me a lot about this, like having these huge opportunities and these big characters-building and breakout moments at your disposal, and you gotta make the most of them. Then when something like tonight happens and it just slips through your fingers, it’s happened before in amateur wrestling, but I learned to persevere, like find my way through it and realize that that’s not the end. I promise you, in this situation, it’s the same thing.</p><p>That’s not the end, for a number of reasons. One, because I have a legacy to protect here. We can talk all the ‘haha’ stuff you want, ‘Thank you’ and ‘Shoosh.’ All that’s fun, and it’s a good time to do that to people and fun to play along with. But there’s also times where, when it’s my kids sitting in the front freaking row, and we got Gunther out there, talking to them, saying, ‘Is this your daddy,’ and chopping me in front of them, my daughter’s crying her freaking eyes out, it kind of stops being fun at a certain point. So that bothers me at a certain level. So you have my word, I swear to you, I swear to everybody, on myself and my career, that’s not the end. I’m taking the Intercontinental Championship. I want him to keep it as long as it freaking takes for me to get a rematch. Because I’m coming back for it, and I swear to god, I’m winning that championship.”</p><p>We will have to wait and see whether Chad Gable will be eventually able to defeat Gunther for the Intercontinental Championship, as Gunther will now make history very soon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your opinion on Chad Gable losing to Gunther?
