The youngster made a number of appearances on red carpets with her family, and even had small role as a dancer in&nbsp;Hannah Montana: The Movie, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>with her big sister</a> Miley! At such a young age, Noah was already starting to get a taste of what the world of entertainment would look like, and she wasn’t at all deterred by any of it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/noah-cyrus-then-and-now-everett-embed.jpg>In fact, <a href=#>when Noah was only a teenager</a> she began her career in music. At 16, Noah’s debut single arrived. The starlet’s emotional, experimental single “Make Me (Cry),” a duet with&nbsp;<strong>Labrinth</strong>, skyrocketed her to fame and totally distanced herself from her siblings’ work while cementing her own, unique style and talent. The single was a huge success, and led to major recognition.<p id=content-paragraph-5>Noah has been nominated for a number of MTV Video Music Awards in her career thus far. But the best nomination came in 2020, when she earned recognition from the Recording Academy and was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>nominated for Best New Artist</a>! The nomination capped off two successful albums from Noah — 2018’s&nbsp;Good Cry and 2020’s&nbsp;The End of Everything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/noah-cyrus-then-and-now-ap-embed.jpg>The future looks so bright for Noah Cyrus.
