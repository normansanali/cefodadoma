Tune in every week to marvel at the costumes, listen to the performances, uncover new clues, and watch the judges try to guess who's hidden behind each mask.</p><p>Throughout the season, we — along with the judges — will try to guess the famous faces hidden behind 16 different masked singers. Read on for the running list of The Masked Singer Season 7 reveals!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is McTerrier on 'The Masked Singer'? It's celebrity pastry chef Duff Goldman!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span><p>Duff Goldman revealed to be McTerrier</p></figure><p>Though we only had a brief period of time to try to figure out who could be hiding under <a href=#>McTerrier</a>'s mask, very few could have expected it to be celebrity pastry chef <a href=#>Duff Goldman</a>. The Ace of Cakes star was the first to be revealed in Season 7, shocking fans who thought it could be Scottish singer-songwriter <a href=#>Lewis Capaldi</a> or professional wrestler <a href=#>Drew McIntyre</a>.</p><p>While this was certainly a tricky one, hardcore fans of Duff may have picked up on the clue of a bass guitar. The pastry chef has played bass in several different indie-rock bands, and also frequently plays the drums.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Ram on 'The Masked Singer'? It's Emmy-winning sportscaster Joe Buck!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span><p>Joe Buck revealed to be Ram</p></figure><p>While many fans assumed <a href=#>Ram</a> was a football player, astute viewers (including guest judge Eric Stonestreet) were able to figure out that Ram was Emmy-winning <a href=#>Fox News sportscaster Joe Buck</a>. Clues spoke of him following in the footsteps of "Papa Ram." (His father, Jack Buck, was also a sportscaster.) We were shown a sign that read "Hamlet x Macbeth" — a hint to him being a "play-by-play" announcer — and a football helmet with the number 6. (Joe has commented on six Super Bowls.)</p><p>On the same day as Joe's reveal, ESPN announced that they had signed a multi-year deal with the sportscaster. Beginning with the 2022 NFL season, Joe will be the play-by-play voice of Monday Night Football.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Cyclops on 'The Masked Singer'? It's actor and comedian Jorge Garcia!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span><p>Jorge Garcia revealed to be Cyclops</p></figure><p>Not many saw it coming when <a href=#>Cyclops</a> was revealed to be actor Jorge Garcia, best known for his role as Hurley on Lost. But looking back on the clues, so many of them should have tipped us off! A treasure map and a compass are clear allusions to Lost, and could also be connected to his work on Hawaii Five-0 and the upcoming film When We Were Pirates. The cowboy hat was a nod to his role in The Ridiculous 6, while the comic book was a hint that he's also a comedian.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Thingamabob on 'The Masked Singer'? It's Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Jordan Mailata!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span><p>Jordan Mailata revealed to be Thingamabob</p></figure><p>We have to give ourselves a pat on the back for this one because we totally called it! On the March 23 episode, <a href=#>Thingamabob</a> was revealed to be Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Jordan Mailata. Hints in the clue package such as a flying eagle and a reference to the song "Hotel California" by The Eagles made it pretty clear that the guy had a strong connection to our national bird. Clues linking him to <a href=#>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</a> pointed at their shared Samoan descent, while the hint of a bulldog referred to his rugby career with Australia's Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Lemur on 'The Masked Singer'? It's supermodel Christie Brinkley!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span><p>Christie Brinkley revealed to be Lemur</p></figure><p>While we didn't have long to make our guesses as to who was hiding under <a href=#>Lemur's</a> mask, many fans were surprised to see supermodel <a href=#>Christie Brinkley</a> be revealed on the March 30 episode. Given the clues, many assumed the secret singer was a YouTube or social media influencer in her 20s. The fact of the matter is that Christie is an influencer, just of a different age! Clues such as the Lemur saying, "I’m here to define my generation," pointed to the 68-year-old jewelry designer, who has long been helping to define an older generation of women who look and feel half their age.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Hydra on 'The Masked Singer'? It's magicians and comedians Penn and Teller!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span><p>Penn and Teller revealed to be Hydra</p></figure><p>Not many saw it coming when <a href=#>Penn and Teller</a> were revealed to be <a href=#>Hydra</a> on the April 6 episode of The Masked Singer. Judge Ken Jeong firmly believed it was a trio of people (specifically pals Chevy Chase, Steve Martin, and Martin Short), so he certainly got a surprise when the mask was removed to reveal the legendary magicians and a stuffed rabbit in a hat.</p><p>While many viewers were also shocked to see the duo, some Reddit users have thought it could be them for a while, based primarily on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Penn's very distinctive voice</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Armadillo on 'The Masked Singer'? It's Duane Chapman aka Dog the Bounty Hunter!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span><p>Dog the Bounty Hunter revealed to be Armadillo</p></figure><p>We'd be lying if we said we weren't giving ourselves a high five for this one because we knew all along that <a href=#>Armadillo</a> was <a href=#>Dog the Bounty Hunter</a>! He's famous for his sunglasses and being big into motorcycles, both of which were pointed out in his clues. Not to mention, his Mega Clue stressed the word "dead," which we definitely thought was a reference to Duane's bounty hunting.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Miss Teddy on 'The Masked Singer'? It's Grammy- and Tony-Winning iconic Jennifer Holliday!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span><p>Jennifer Holliday revealed to be Miss Teddy</p></figure><p>It seemed like many fans had been calling all along that <a href=#>Miss Teddy</a> was musical icon Jennifer Holliday. Clues such as her Grammy Awards and the image of Santa (Jennifer Holliday ... holiday) were almost too easy to figure out. But it was likely all those references to Dreamgirls that really sealed the deal for viewers. Jennifer originated the Broadway role of Effie in 1981 and later won the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical and a Grammy for her recorded version of 'And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going.'</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Jack in the Box on 'The Masked Singer'? It's Rudy Giuliani.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span><p>Rudy Giuliani revealed to be Jack in the Box</p></figure><p>Fans weren't surprised to see Trump's personal attorney, <a href=#>Rudy Giuliani</a>, be revealed as <a href=#>Jack in the Box</a> on the April 20 episode of The Masked Singer. Following a report that the former New York City mayor would compete on the show, viewers have been waiting to see him be unmasked. Most knew it was Giuliani all along due to the lack of promotional materials on his character. Many believed Fox was trying to downplay his appearance on the show following the backlash they received after the news broke.</p><p>As previously reported, not everyone was happy to see Giuliani, particularly judges Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke, who <a href=#>walked off the stage when he was revealed</a>. Fans took to Twitter to share their thoughts on what happened and as expected, opinions were divided. Some fans applauded Ken and Robin for taking a stand, while others criticized the walk-off as "unprofessional," saying that shows like The Masked Singer should just keep politics out of it altogether.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Baby Mammoth on 'The Masked Singer'? It's actress Kirstie Alley!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span><p>Kirstie Alley revealed to be Baby Mammoth</p></figure><p>Fans Cheers-ed (get it?) when they saw actress <a href=#>Kirstie Alley</a> be revealed as the woman behind the <a href=#>Baby Mammoth</a> mask on the April 27 episode of The Masked Singer. Having only first appeared the week prior, there weren't too many clues to go on, but several viewers guessed it was Kirstie based on her recognizable voice. Savvy fans also pinpointed clues that referenced several of Kirstie's acting roles. The various twos were likely meant to point her role in the 1995 family comedy It Takes Two, while the ice and cheerleading references were clear indications of her time playing bar manager Rebecca Howe on the hit sitcom Cheers.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Space Bunny on 'The Masked Singer'? It's Grammy winner Shaggy!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span><p>Space Bunny revealed to be Shaggy</p></figure><p>We have to pat ourselves on the back because we totally knew that Grammy Award-winning singer Shaggy was <a href=#>hiding under the Space Bunny mask</a>. Clues such as the state of North Carolina, the basketball on fire, and the red handprint all pointed to various songs or albums released by the singer ("Oh, Carolina," "Hot Shot," and "It Wasn't Me," respectively). But perhaps the biggest clue of all was simply his voice. If you've ever listened to Shaggy, it would be hard to miss his signature raspy Jamaican sound!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Queen Cobra on 'The Masked Singer'? It's R&B girl group En Vogue!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span><p>Queen Cobras revealed to be En Vogue</p></figure><p>This was another one we felt pretty confident in, and it turns out we were right! From early on, we thought it had to be a girl group of some kind. When we were then shown a total of six Queen Cobras, we <a href=#>zeroed in on En Vogue</a>, who have had six different members of the group over the years. Specifically, the voice of Cindy Herron singing the solo in the first song took us straight back to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1990's "Hold On."</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Prince on 'The Masked Singer'? It's Broadway and TV star Cheyenne Jackson!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span><p>Cheyenne Jackson revealed to be Prince</p></figure><p>May 18 marked the Season 7 finale of The Masked Singer, and it was a doozy! The first to be unmasked of the night was Prince, who many were unsurprised see be revealed as <a href=#>Broadway and TV star Cheyenne Jackson</a>. Clues such as the number 30, the diamond ring, and the photo of Carnegie Hall pointed to Cheyenne's various projects (30 Rock, his character of Johnny Diamond on American Housewife, and his musical at Carnegie Hall, to be exact). But perhaps it was when <a href=#>Jamie Lee Curtis</a> shared on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> that The Prince was her "celeb bestie" that many connected the dots!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Ringmaster on 'The Masked Singer'? It's actress and singer Hayley Orrantia!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span><p>Hayley Orrantia revealed to be Ringmaster</p></figure><p>Making it all the way to the final two, Ringmaster was the second to last to be unmasked on the Season 7 finale. When the mask came off, she was revealed to be <a href=#>actress and singer Hayley Orrantia</a>, who's perhaps best known for her role on ABC's The Goldbergs. Though several viewers thought Ringmaster be could Olivia Rodrigo, savvy viewers caught on to the references to her southern roots and her work with Miley Cyrus.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Firefly on 'The Masked Singer'? It's singer, actress, and dancer Teyana Taylor!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span><p>Teyana Taylor revealed to be Firefly</p></figure><p>Finishing up a phenomenal night was the unmasking of someone who's delivered powerhouse performances throughout the entire season: Firefly. If we're being honest, the clues here were pretty easy. Hints such as her Harlem upbringing, her connection to Tyler Pretty, and the use of the word "fade" (she has her Fade2Fit workout program and danced in Kanye's music video for "Fade"), all lined up to be singer, actress, dancer, choreographer, and all-around fashionista <a href=#>Teyana Taylor</a>. She may not have fooled us behind her mask, but she still walked away the winner of the Golden Mask Trophy!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmecyaqqSdlGLAqrrGnqlmq5WWwLC6jHBkq52mmq6tvw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
