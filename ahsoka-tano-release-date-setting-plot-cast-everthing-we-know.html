It's hard to believe that there was a point in time when fans thought the idea of <a href=#><strong>Anakin Skywalker</strong></a> having a padawan was preposterous since no such thing had ever even been mentioned in the live-action films. Yet, slowly but surely, young Ahsoka captured the hearts of the fandom, going from an arrogant learner into a patient Jedi Knight in <a href=#><strong>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</strong></a>. When she left the Jedi Order to have a new life, many assumed that was the end of her journey, and yet she still chose to fight the good fight in <a href=#><strong>Star Wars Rebels</strong></a>, even coming face to face with her former master, now corrupted into the evil Darth Vader. Her duel with Vader also should have been the end of her journey, yet she somehow cheated death and finally made her glorious live-action debut in <strong>The Mandalorian</strong>, even making a <a href=#><strong>brief appearance in The Book of Boba Fett</strong></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that the fan favorite has become a household name, her story is set to continue once again with her very own live-action series. Two and a half years after it was first announced, <strong>Ahsoka</strong> is almost here, and we finally got some long-awaited details for her first-ever solo series, so here's everything we know so far about Snips's next series adventure.</p><p>Editor's Note: This article was last updated on August 19, 2023</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ahsoka-poster-2.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title=Ahsoka>Ahsoka</a></h5>Sci-Fi<p class=display-card-description>After the fall of the Galactic Empire, former Jedi Ahsoka Tano investigates an emerging threat to a vulnerable galaxy.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>August 1, 2023</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Rosario Dawson</a> , <a data-id href=#>Hayden Christensen</a> , <a data-id href=#>Ray Stevenson</a> , <a data-id href=#>Mary Elizabeth Winstead</a></span> <strong>Main Genre</strong> <span>Sci-Fi</span> <strong>Seasons</strong> <span>1</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-and-where-is-ahsoka-premiering>When and Where Is Ahsoka Premiering?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ahsoka-teaser-trailer-rosario-dawson.jpg><p>Ahsoka will premiere on August 23, 2023, exclusively on Disney+. If you haven't already, you can catch up on all the Star Wars shows as we get closer to Ahsoka.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Watch on Disney+</a></span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="'Tales of the Jedi' Left Out This Crucial Queer Character From Ahsoka's Novel">Disney+ Subscribers Will Get Early Access to 'Ahsoka' Merch</a></span></p><h2 id=watch-the-ahsoka-trailers>Watch the Ahsoka Trailers</h2><p>Back in 2022, <a href=#>some footage did debut at the show's panel at Star Wars Celebration</a>, though unfortunately for those not in attendance, the sizzle reel was held behind closed doors. As expected plot details were kept under wraps, but it did reveal a major connection to Rebels with a confirmation that Twi'Lek pilot of the Ghost Hera Syndulla would appear, along with a few other returning characters. We also got an <a href=#>extremely brief first public look</a> at this show in Disney+'s 2023 sizzle reel, where we see Ahsoka taking off her hood before her next adventure hits the streaming service. Not a bombshell reveal, but the footage potentially means that a new trailer won't be far behind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, on April 7, 2023, <a href=#>the first official teaser trailer for Ahsoka was released</a> to the public during Star Wars Celebration 2023. The teaser runs at just under two minutes and gives us our first look at the live-action debut of Star Wars Rebels alumni Sabine Wren, Hera Syndulla, and a brief look at Ezra Bridger. The trailer also teased the arrival of Grand Admiral Thrawn and a look at the new Sith character Baylan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On July 11, 2023, Disney and Lucasfilm released <a href=#>the full official trailer for Ahsoka</a>. The trailer gives us our first full look at Grand Admiral Thrawn in action, and we briefly hear Ezra Bridger talk via a hologram telling Sabine "As a Jedi, sometimes you have to make decisions no one else can. I'm counting on you to see this through."</p><p>A <a href=#>new teaser for Ahsoka</a> was released on August 11 as well, showing Ahsoka training Sabine Wren. See it here:</p><p>On August 13, another teaser followed, this time focusing on <a href=#>Ahsoka's relationship with her own master, Anakin Skywalker</a>. Here it is:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-the-plot-of-ahsoka>What Is the Plot of Ahsoka?</h2><p>Like pretty much every recent Star Wars project, plot details are being kept to a strict minimum, but that doesn't mean we don't have a pretty good idea of where Ahsoka's story is going next. Towards the end of her episode on The Mandalorian, Ahsoka's goal became quite clear. After her duel with Morgan Elsbeth, Ahsoka made it clear that she was on the hunt for a bigger fish: <a href=#><strong>Grand Admiral Thrawn</strong></a>, the Chiss Imperial leader and a major antagonist from Star Wars Rebels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite tangling with a multitude of Sith Lords and Inquisitors, Thrawn was one of the most ruthless and formidable opponents that the band of Rebels had ever faced, pushing the team to their physical and mental limits. The show's conclusion felt less like an ending and more of a cliffhanger, with both Thrawn and Rebels protagonist <a href=#><strong>Ezra Bridger</strong></a> disappearing into the vastness of space. So if Thrawn truly is alive like Ahsoka believes he is, there's a good chance that Ezra could still be out there as well, making Ahsoka not just a continuation of Tano's story, but also a direct sequel to Star Wars Rebels.</p><p>The official synopsis for the series reads:</p><p>Set after the fall of the Empire, Ahsoka will follow the former Jedi Knight Ahsoka Tano as she investigates an emerging threat to a vulnerable galaxy.</p><h2 id=who-is-in-the-cast-of-ahsoka>Who Is in the Cast of Ahsoka?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/swa_payoff_digital_ka_v7_lg.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once again, Ahsoka will be brought to life by Rosario Dawson (Daredevil), who got her wish to portray the role after a viral fan campaign. Her warm reception from the rest of the community after her Mandalorian appearance seemed to confirm to Lucasfilm that she was the right choice, although hopefully the original voice actor for Ahsoka's animated appearances, <a href=#><strong>Ashley Eckstein</strong></a>, at least has a cameo appearance.</p><p>Remember earlier when we said that we might be getting some Clone Wars flashbacks? Well, the biggest piece of evidence for that is the confirmed return of <strong>Hayden Christensen</strong> (Revenge of the Sith) as Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka's former master as well as the man who would become Darth Vader. Given that Ahsoka takes place after Return of the Jedi, Anakin has been long dead at this point, meaning the most likely places we'll be seeing him is in a Clone Wars flashback with Anakin and Ahsoka fighting off battle droids. Or perhaps we'll even see a brief return to the duel between Vader and Tano.</p><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ahsoka also isn't the only character making the jump from animation to live-action, as <strong>Natasha Liu Bordizzo</strong> (Day Shift)<strong> </strong><a href=#>will be playing Sabine Wren</a>, a Mandalorian freedom fighter who once was in possession of the fabled <a href=#><strong>Darksaber</strong></a>. How she lost the Saber to Moff Gideon will probably be addressed, but the character's inclusion makes perfect sense given her close relationship and friendship with Ahsoka. <strong>Eman Esfandi</strong> (King Richard) will be playing another Rebels alumnus <a href=#>in the young Jedi Ezra Bridger</a>, who is currently missing at this point in the Star Wars timeline. <strong><a href=#>Mary Elizabeth Winstead</a></strong> (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) will be playing Hera Syndulla, a former rebel pilot who was one of the main characters on Star Wars Rebels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The late <strong><a href=#>Ray Stevenson</a></strong> (Thor) will play a Sith named Baylan, and <strong>David Tennant </strong>(Doctor Who) will play the lightsaber-crafting droid Huyang, a character he previously voiced in The Clone Wars.<strong> </strong><a href=#><strong>Ivanna Sakhno</strong></a> (Pacific Rim: Uprising) will also star in the series in an undisclosed role. <strong>Genevieve O'Reilly </strong>will reprise her role as Mon Mothma after having played the role in <strong>Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</strong>, <strong>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</strong>, and most recently on <strong>Andor</strong>. <strong>Diana Lee Inosanto </strong>will be reprising her role as Morgan Elsbeth after making an appearance in The Mandalorian.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stc-trailer2_uhd_r709f_stills_230711-088707.jpg><p>It was also revealed that<strong> Lars Mikkelsen</strong> will be playing the live-action version of the iconic character Grand Admiral Thrawn, after previously voicing the character in animated form in Star Wars Rebels.

This feels remarkably appropriate given that Ahsoka is one of the first Star Wars characters that Filoni personally created for The Clone Wars, not to mention being the creator of Rebels as well. As per usual, Filoni will also be producing the show alongside <strong>Jon Favreau</strong> and <strong>Kathleen Kennedy</strong>. As if Filoni wasn't already doing enough, he's also going to be <a href=#>directing the first and fifth episodes</a>. <strong>Steph Green</strong> (The Book of Boba Fett) is directing Episodes 2 and 3; <a href=#><strong>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</strong>'s <strong>Peter Ramsey</strong></a> directs Episode 4; <strong>Jennifer Getzinger </strong>(Daredevil) is the director of Episode 6; <strong>Geeta Vasant Patel </strong>(House of the Dragon) directs Episode 7, and <strong>Rick Famuyiwa</strong> is the director for the finale. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rosario Dawson has previously praised Filoni's work</a> and said she wants to keep working together and bring Ahsoka to life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I hope that he [Filoni] continues to bring Ahsoka along. Because he's been very loyal to her over the years, and she to him. That's not going away any time soon. So any kind of way and iteration that I can keep working with Dave, and being inspired by him, and challenging him when I can – it would be awesome.</p><h2 id=will-ahsoka-be-getting-a-season-2>Will Ahsoka be Getting a Season 2?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stc-003402_r.jpg><p>Currently, Ahsoka is being billed as a miniseries, which implies that this will be a single-season effort. However, fans of Tano shouldn't give up hope just yet, as some Disney+ shows have been announced as a miniseries and then suddenly got picked up for another season, a prime example being <a href=#><strong>Loki</strong></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It really just depends on how well the series performs and where Ahsoka's story ends up and whether or not a full-blown sequel is justified or desired, and since the show is following a character as popular as Ahsoka as well as the other Rebels characters, it's hard to imagine that it'll be a flop.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Star Wars: 10 Characters That Could Make an Appearance in Disney+ Ahsoka">‘Star Wars’ Favorite Rebels Are Ready to Take on Thrawn in New ‘Ahsoka’ Images</a></span></p><h2 id=when-does-ahsoka-take-place-in-the-star-wars-timeline>When Does Ahsoka Take Place in the Star Wars Timeline?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stc-009927_r.jpg><p>Several decades after she joined the franchise in The Clone Wars, her story in Ahsoka will be her most recent adventure to date in terms of when it's set. With Rosario Dawson continuing to play the titular role, Ahsoka is expected to take place some time after the events of her <a href=#><strong>live-action debut in The Mandalorian Season 2</strong></a>, and presumably after her brief cameo in The Book of Boba Fett (although here's hoping we get to see the first meeting between Ahsoka and Luke).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For those.curious how this fits into the timeline of the films, this would place Ahsoka somewhere in between the events of <strong>Return of the Jedi</strong> and <strong>The Force Awakens</strong>, so after the fall of the Empire and before the rise of the First Order.

Of course, for those of you who may be new to Ahsoka's story, the <a href=#>best place to begin your journey is the original animated series</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51krqm%2FzqSYZqyRo7xuvsSlnJqrlWKxosDEZqqerKSeu6h5z6WmrWWTlsC1ecSvnKusmJ67qHnWnmSkpp%2BsfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
