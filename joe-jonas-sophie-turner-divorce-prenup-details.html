Jonas and Turner had been together since late 2016. They went Instagram official only a few months later, confirming for the world that they were together. Jonas proposed roughly a year into their relationship, and the celebrities had two wedding celebrations. The first was held in Las Vegas, where they exchanged ring pops, while a second, much more formal wedding occurred in the south of France.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Joe Jonas Gives Statement To Fans Amid Divorce, But Refuses To Address Allegations Against Sophie Turner</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, despite having two children together, Jonas and Turner decided to part ways. They shared the news on their social media, but news outlets had already broken the news that Jonas filed for divorce. Lucky for them, their prenup was ironclad and both their funds are completely safe from the other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=details-about-the-joe-jonas-and-sophie-turner-divorce>Details About The Joe Jonas And Sophie Turner Divorce</h2><p>Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner were married since 2019. They had two wedding ceremonies, in fact, one in the United States and one in the south of France. The first was held in Las Vegas after the Billboard Music Awards, and their second ceremony was much more formal. The couple shared adorable photos from the event on their social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/joe-jonas-and-sophie-turner-weight-loss.jpg><p>Since tying the knot, Jonas and Turner have given birth to two daughters. Their first daughter was born in 2020 and is named Willa, while their second daughter was born in 2022. Jonas and Turner have chosen not to share the name of their second child for the sake of privacy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though all seemed well between Jonas and Turner, that was apparently not the case. When TMZ broke the news that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonas had filed for divorce</a>, a source revealed that the couple had been having serious problems for several months.</p><p>"She likes to party, he likes to stay at home. They have very different lifestyles," one source revealed to the outlet.</p><p>Turner has been in England for that last few months filming, and Jonas has been alone with their children.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Joe Jonas And Sophie Turner Had A Strict Rule To Walking On The Red Carpet Together</a></span></p><p>The most interesting piece of information that TMZ revealed was the catalyst for Jonas's decision to file for divorce. Jonas reportedly had "access to a ring cam that he said captured Sophie saying and/or doing something that made him realize the marriage was over."</p><p>Fans have been speculating what could have been in the video, and if there are <a href=#>other reasons behind the divorce</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-was-in-joe-jonas-and-sophie-turner-39-s-prenup>What Was In Joe Jonas And Sophie Turner's Prenup?</h2><p>It is not surprising that Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner elected to have a prenup when they got married. Having a prenup is very common for celebrities and those with great wealth, as it protects both parties if a divorce were ever to occur. It also ensures each party that the other is not marrying them for their money.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/joe-jonas-and-wife-sophie-turner-weight-loss-skinny-face-buccal-fat-removal-then-and-now.jpg><p>Jonas and Turner elected to have a prenup because of their individual success. Jonas has been a very successful and profitable musician since he was a teenager. Most of his income has come from the band with his brothers, the Jonas Brothers, while some came from his other band DNCE.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Turner comes from a very different side of the entertainment industry. As an actress, Turner grew in popularity after starring in the HBO series Game of Thrones. Since the show's end, Turner has continued to steadily work in film and television.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Their prenup agreement ensures that their incomes from their separate endeavors are protected</a>. Jonas will keep all of his music money and his royalties, and Turner will keep all of her acting money. Finances from their image and likeness with their celebrity status is also protected.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Emily Ratajkowski Hints That She Supports Sophie Turner Amid Divorce From Joe Jonas</a></span></p><p>Jonas and Turner chose to take their prenup a step further and include their assets, specifically their assets in real estate.</p><p>While married, Jonas and Turner shared homes in Los Angeles, Miami, and England. Their prenup dictates that whoever owned the property before they got married will remain the sole owner of the house.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The only house that will be split in the divorce is their marital home. It can be assumed that they will sell the property and split the profits.</p><h2 id=will-joe-jonas-have-to-pay-child-support>Will Joe Jonas Have To Pay Child Support?</h2><p>Child support in a divorce can be a tricky thing, especially when both parents make sizable incomes. A custody agreement can be just as complicated, and Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner's busy schedules does not help the matter.</p><p>People revealed that for the last three months <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonas has been the sole parent for their two daughters</a> due to Turner's schedule.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar51487579.png><p>"She has been shooting which is why the kids have been with Joe. It's just easier because she's been working for the kids to be with him because there's some more support at home and on the road with his family. It's something they both agreed was best."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jonas has been taking their children with him while he tours with his brothers.</p><p>When it comes down to a custody agreement, this could come back to haunt Turner if a judge determines that Jonas is the primary caregiver. With Turner's strong feelings about moving back to England, there could also be a heavy debate over where the children will live.</p><p>The more interesting conversation is regarding child support. The amount will be based off of monthly income of both Jonas and Turner. If it is determined that Jonas makes more money on a monthly basis, he will likely be forced to pay Turner child support. However, this can always be reassessed down the road if Jonas feels Turner is making more later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqJ1dn7yvrdJmqqiomJ6ybsDUq6Weql2Ztre70ZycZqiimru2vIydnK2ZmaHAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
