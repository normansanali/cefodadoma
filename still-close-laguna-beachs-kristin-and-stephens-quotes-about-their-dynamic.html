Kristin Cavallari and Stephen Colletti captured fans’ attention in 2004 when their relationship played out on seasons 1 and 2 of Laguna Beach.
The high school sweethearts’ on-again, off-again romance kept MTV viewers wondering whether they were end game or if Colletti would pursue a relationship with longtime friend Lauren Conrad. While Cavallari and Colletti’s teenage love affair fizzled out after the One Tree Hill alum graduated from school — he is one year older than the Hills star — the two have remained close."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While Cavallari and Colletti’s <a href=#>teenage love affair</a> fizzled out after the <a href=#>One Tree Hill</a> alum graduated from school — he is one year older than <a href=#>the Hills</a> star — the two have remained close.</p><p>“We’re friends. I speak to them from time to time,” the Everyone Is Doing Great producer <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in July 2018 of his dynamic with both Cavallari and Conrad post-high school. “I’ll go down. Conrad will throw a killer 4th of July party in Laguna, and so I’m usually down there for that. And then, yeah, <a href=#>I’ll speak with Cavallari from time to time</a>. We always just check in and say hello.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Very Cavallari alum</a>, who was married to <a href=#><strong>Jay Cutler</strong></a> for seven years before announcing <a href=#>their split in April 2020</a>, reflected on her “great” relationship with Colletti while writing her 2016 book, <a href=#>Balancing in Heels: My Journey to Health, Happiness, and Making It All Work</a>.</p><p>Cavallari claimed that her <a href=#>mean girl personality on screen</a> was a result of her fighting to keep her relationship with Colletti afloat despite producers pressuring him to hang out with Conrad.</p><p>“I did the only thing I knew how to do: put up a wall. That made it look like I didn’t care about anyone but myself. But Stephen was the most important thing in my life, and there was nothing I cared about more,” the Uncommon James founder, who shares <a href=#>Camden, Jaxon and Saylor</a> with the former NFL player, wrote at the time. “I hated fighting with him on camera because it felt like I was airing all our dirty laundry … To some I seemed confident and beyond my high school years; to others, I seemed like a mean girl. Either way, I was shocked and sad that I was being portrayed as anything but myself: <a href=#>a sarcastic, goofy girl who just wanted to have fun</a>.”</p><p>In the years since high school, fans have continued to <a href=#>hold a torch for Cavallari and Colletti</a> — as have some of their childhood friends.</p><p>“I love that so much. It was so cute to see them together,” <a href=#><strong>Alex Hooser</strong></a> said during a September 2020 appearance on “The Gay & The Girl” podcast, <a href=#>referencing the exes’ reunion photo that they took earlier that summer</a>. “I don’t know [if they’ll get together]. I hope so. I feel like if those two came together and went to MTV and were like, ‘OK, we’re ready to do this,’ they’d be like, ‘OK, it’s on.’”</p><p>The <a href=#>Mox cofounder was completely on board</a> with the idea of her pals rekindling their romance.</p><p>“I would love that. That is full circle,” Hooser continued. “I’m the one originally, like, when they first, I somewhat introduced Stephen to Kristin because I was friends with Stephen and I, like, gave him or her — I gave one of them each other’s number.”</p><p>Scroll down to see what Cavallari and Colletti have said about their friendship over the years:</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Usmagazine.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toq6Seua15wqWmrJ1doa6owc2aZJudkZi1tHnKq6CsrJmjeqK6w2aqrZ2gnbKvv4yqrKislah6oq7OrqtmrJiatrN5w7KlmqWZmHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
