In all seriousness, this holiday means two things to me – brunch with family & friends and the start of berry season (yay!). So I’ve picked out a few recipes you could serve at an Easter brunch, and a few&nbsp;that are less Easter-y and just scream spring me to me (I’m looking at you, Sunshine Chia Bowls).

I don’t know where you live, but it’s been absolutely gorgeous around here lately so I’m going to brag about it a little bit. The sun is shining, colorful vegetables are showing up at&nbsp;the markets, and mint (a.k.a&nbsp;the only thing my black thumb can “grow”), is spreading like a weed in our yard.
