As the franchise gains popularity, the amount each Housewife gets paid per episode jumps up, especially for a popular Housewife. Tenure is also a factor when it comes to per-episode pay. The longer a Housewife remains in the main cast, the higher their per-episode pay becomes.</p><p>The per-episode salary varies from person to person. <a href=#>NeNe Leakes</a>, for example, was the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">highest-paid</a> Housewife before leaving The Real Housewives of Atlanta. It was reported that she made $2.85 million dollars in her final season.</p><p>So, how much does the Season 14 cast of <a href=#>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</a> make per episode? There are bound to be some top earners in this cast, especially for the OG members.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span><p>Margaret Josephs, Jenn Fessler, Melissa Gorga, Rachel Fuda, and Danielle Cabral</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">How much does the 'RHONJ' cast get paid per episode?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parade</a>, <a href=#>Jennifer Aydin</a> reportedly makes around $100K per season. <a href=#>Margaret Josephs</a>'s per-episode pay reportedly sits roughly between $30,000 to $60,000 per episode, while <a href=#>Dolores Catania</a>, who joined the cast in Season 6, reportedly makes around $60,000 each episode.</p><p><a href=#>Melissa Gorga</a> joined the series as an official Housewife during Season 3, and so it's likely she makes a hefty sum per episode as well — a reported $750K per season, in fact.</p><p><a href=#>Danielle Cabral</a> and <a href=#>Rachel Fuda</a> both joined the cast in Season 13, and it's unknown how much they are currently making, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bethenny Frankel has said</a> there's typically a set salary that everyone gets as they begin their first season. It's likely Danielle and Rachel's salaries have increased going into their second season.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span><p>Teresa Giudice</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Teresa Giudice is the highest-paid Housewife in the 'RHONJ' cast.</h2><p>The most tenured cast member of RHONJ is <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a>, and it makes <a href=#>absolute sense</a> that she is the highest-paid Housewife in the cast. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life & Style</a>, Teresa reportedly earned $62,000 per episode in 2020, and now that four years have passed since then, it's highly likely that her pay has increased even more.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span><p>John Fuda, Rachel Fuda, Joe Gorga, and Frank Catania</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">'RHONJ' is the only franchise were the husbands also get paid per episode.</h2><p>Out of the multitude of franchises that have popped up under the Real Housewives banner, RHONJ is the only cast in which the husbands are also paid a per-episode rate, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture</a>. There is a clause in the Housewives' contracts that includes <a href=#>their husbands</a>, meaning that scenes were able to be filmed with just <a href=#>the husbands</a>, even when the Housewives are on their trips. Their children also receive a stipend for appearing on the show once they reach the age of 18.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span><p>Melissa Gorga and Jackie Goldschneider</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Official friends of the Housewives get a lower per-episode rate.</h2><p>Friends of any <a href=#>Bravo</a> series have a set rate earned per episode. Because they are not main cast players, the pay decreases significantly, with a reported <a href=#>starting rate</a> of $1,000 per episode. Recently, <a href=#>Melissa insinuated</a> that former main cast member Jackie Goldschneider has befriended Teresa purely for more screen time, as she was demoted to a friend role in the series in Season 13. Jackie said that the decision to step back was a mutual one, as she was dealing with mental and physical health issues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyumqFllKSytHnRoaanol2YrrTAjKCcrWWglralec%2BeqWadoJ7AsLDE</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
