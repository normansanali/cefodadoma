Two decades later, Berlant’s penchant for connecting with people through humor is a signature part of both her personal and professional life. Her latest project, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Would It Kill You To Laugh</a>, a surreal Peacock sketch comedy special she created with close friend and fellow comedian <a href=# class=T3D>John Early</a>, encompasses both, riffing on a fictionalized version of their friendship gone sour.</p><p></p><p>Yet in real life, Berlant and Early’s relationship couldn’t be more pure. “We arrived at a friendship in a very automatic, innocent way that does remind me of myself at that age — just the uncomplicated connection of making someone laugh and someone making you laugh so deeply,” Berlant says.</p><p>Below, Berlant talks wheelie backpacks, water bras, and showing off her Lizzie McGuire hairdo at school.</p><p><strong>Take me back to 2001-2002, when you were 14. What were your biggest hopes and worries?</strong></p><p>I was [living] in LA. I'm a little young for my year, so I was in the ninth grade. I somehow bypassed the anxiety [of adolescence]. I had no romantic prospects whatsoever. My friends were all really pretty, and a lot of them at that point were getting attention from boys, and I certainly was not. I was tiny. In my memory, I was 4'11" and 60 pounds, and I had a wheelie backpack and a retainer. There was a purity and a true innocence to my life then.</p><p><strong>Did you have a wheelie backpack because you were concerned about your posture?</strong></p><p>I think I already was hypochondriac, and I think I feared the heaviness. I was like, "Well, we all know heavy books, they're bad for the back!"</p><p><strong>Were you already thinking about a career in comedy at that age?</strong></p><p>I wanted to be an actress. I did stand-up for the first time when I was 17. But at 14 my best friend at the time — who's still a huge part of my life and is a writer — she wrote the school plays and I would star in them. I think she was the president and I was the vice president of thespian society. We definitely created the theater department at our little high school. My ambition was always to be an actress, and everything I did was comedy at that point. But I hadn't really considered that what I actually wanted was to be a comedian as well.</p><p><strong>You also had your first credited role around that age, on Lizzie McGuire in 2002. How did that come to be?</strong></p><p>Yeah, that was actually [through] my best friend. I got an audition through her mom's friend for Lizzie McGuire and to my absolute shock, I booked it. Since then, I've almost never gotten a job from an audition. It was totally surreal. I loved Lizzie McGuire. Got the full Lizzie McGuire hairdo, which I then wore to school the next day. I had two lines, but I believe it was cut down to one, "Lizzie, I love your pants" or, "Hey, Lizzie, very cool pants." And I was on top of the world. What can I say?</p><p><strong>What was the hairdo?</strong></p><p>Butterfly clipped. Sort of half up, half down. Something much more elaborate than I had ever experienced.</p><p><strong>This age can also be a delicate time for girls, especially with puberty. Do you remember how you were feeling in your body at 14? Did you feel comfortable in your own skin?</strong></p><p>I think I was so radically desexualized. I was really horny, but no one was perceiving me as a woman or an almost-woman or in any sort of sexual way. I was really just a pure clown. There was no part of me that felt sexy or anything, but I was definitely obsessed with sex. Completely obsessed.</p><p>I would dress up with a couple of my best friends and wish I had boobs. I had a padded bra, and I had a water bra which was exactly what it sounds like — pads filled with water. You could actually hear it. If you're running or something, it would be sloshing. But somehow, I don't remember myself at that age being plagued with body dysmorphia or really obsessing over my body compared to others. I'm sure that was in there, but it's not a defining memory for me at that time.</p><p><strong>Did you have any formative celebrity crushes?</strong></p><p>I was really obsessed with Hedwig and the Angry Inch and Michael Pitt.</p><p><strong>What did you like doing for fun when you were 14?</strong></p><p>I played guitar. I played drums a little bit. I had a little video camera that I was really obsessed with. I brought it to school a lot, and I would film my friends, and I would film everyday life.</p><p><strong>Did you ever edit the footage into anything?</strong></p><p>No, I never edited them, really. I made a couple little things with some friends. Sometimes I’d film them without them knowing, which is kind of strange.</p><p><strong>Do you think the tapes are long gone, or do you still have them?</strong></p><p>Oh God, no. I have them. I never throw anything away!</p><p><strong>Have you ever looked at them since?</strong></p><p>I haven't in a long time, but I have seen them, and my voice is so high. It's unimaginable.</p><p><strong>That's very cute. What were you getting in trouble for at 14?</strong></p><p>I actually did get detention, but it was all for uniform violations. I had a uniform, but a couple times I wore funky socks — you had to only wear black or white or navy socks. I got in trouble for that. I didn't get in any kind of serious trouble; it was mostly just minor uniform violations.</p><p><strong>Were you getting uniform violations because you were like, "Fuck it, I want to express myself," or are you a rule follower who was trying to follow the rules but slipped up?</strong></p><p>I think I am sort of obedient and scared of authority, but I have a huge amount of disdain for authority. So I think I was testing the limits. I definitely was a prankster; I liked being mischievous at school. The teacher wasn't looking, and I jumped up on the table and moved the clock forward — things like that. So I liked kind of harmless, kind of benevolent pranks.</p><p><strong>What do you think your 14-year-old self would think of you now? It seems like you've followed a path you were already setting up even then.</strong></p><p>I think it's weird to think about because I do think that I would be happy to see myself where I am — my hope was that I would be acting and in comedy.</p><p><strong>Is there any advice that you would have given her at the time for what she was going through?</strong></p><p>I think this is what everyone says when they reflect back, but not to worry. I was pretty much a hypochondriac. I was really worried that I had tumors, I was having a heart attack, or things were wrong with me. I was obsessed with my appendix bursting. I had a lot of anxiety about that kind of stuff. So I would like to tell myself, "It's not your appendix, it's just gas."</p><p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqSZpJp6o7HRpZinrF2YvK6xw7JkrKiVmLaiuIyjpqGmXZqus7jYZpidp5yawKSxzZycZqGeqbKzwsierg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
