Joe Alwyn explained why he decided to adopt the pseudonym while attending The Kelly Clarkson Show. Alwyn pointed out that it has a special significance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was a combination of William, my great-grandfather, who I never actually met, (who) was a composer," the Conversations With Friends star said. "He wrote a lot of classical music and he wrote a lot of film scores. And then Bowery is the area in New York that I spent a lot of time in when I first went over there."</p><p>During the latter part of the discussion, Kelly said that the name sounded "very fancy." Alwyn chuckled and said that William Bowery sounded like "a kind of Agatha Christie character who should be wearing a monocle with a big mustache".</p><h2 id=taylor-and-joe-39-s-collaboration-wasn-39-t-planned>Taylor And Joe's Collaboration Wasn't Planned</h2><p>In an interview with GQ Hype, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Joe opened up about his experience of writing with the All Too Well singer</a>. “It was really the most accidental thing to happen in lockdown," he said in the interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He further said, "It wasn’t like, ‘It’s three o’clock, it’s time to write a song! It was just messing around on a piano and singing badly and being overheard and then thinking, you know, what if we tried to get to the end of it together?"</p><p>"It was fun to do together, and I was proud of it. It was nice getting such a positive reception," he later added.</p><p>Before contributing as the songwriter of Sweet Nothing, Joe co-produced several songs on Swift's two albums, Folklore and Evermore.</p><p>The songs included Exile, Betty, My Tears Ricochet, August, This Is Me Trying, and Illicit Affairs. Alwyn later won a Grammy for his work on Folklore.
