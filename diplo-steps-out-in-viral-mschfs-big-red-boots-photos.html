The Big Red Boot works on a similar principle, where it is absurd, implied form that conveys the idea of ‘BOOT’ without worrying too much about the particulars of realism.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s3>Greenberg added: “</span><span class=s1>From a technical perspective, the BRB pushes the envelope of its single-mold-shell design, simply because it is really large … It’s shot in a much higher quality material and process than, say, a rain boot, or other thin-walled low-cost boots.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s1>Making the style even more intriguing, they are actually considered reimagined <a href=#>sneakers</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5m2sbjOZqqtnaCoerDB02agp2Wmnr%2BiuIymqpyglqh6o7XGZqmenF2XvLDA0manoaekpMBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
