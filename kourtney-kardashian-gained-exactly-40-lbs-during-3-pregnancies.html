“I wasn’t into intense workouts when I got pregnant with Mason, and I wasn’t using a trainer at the time,” the Poosh creator, 41, wrote in a May article on her site. “I was very into running, usually a quick two to three-mile run with some good music in my neighborhood, combined with some at-home workouts and uphill walks with the stroller."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I especially loved the built-in bonding time throughout the day, especially once I started working again.”</p><p>Following<a href=#> Penelope’s 2012 birth</a>, Kardashian did “mellow workouts and a lot of yoga” before getting into high-intensity interval training two years later, which she jumped “back into” after <a href=#>Reign’s 2014 arrival</a>.</p><p>“The most important thing is to listen to your body and to do what you’re doing for you, not for society’s standards of getting your body back, because they are unrealistic,” the E! personality concluded. “This was my journey.”</p><p>The California native welcomed her brood with her now ex-boyfriend,<a href=#> <strong>Scott Disick</strong></a>, and now <a href=#>coparents</a> with the Talentless creator, 36.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The fact that we’ve tried and made it work makes life that much better,” the Flip It Like Disick star said of their dynamic in an April 2019 Poosh video. “I couldn’t imagine raising three children with somebody I couldn’t speak to every day.”</p><p>Disick added at the time: “The biggest challenge was just trying to figure out how we separate our relationship as friends and parents and still be on the same page, and what’s, I guess, appropriate and what’s not and when to be able to talk to each other. In the beginning, you set good [boundaries]&nbsp;and we learned from that and we’ve gotten to a good place.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGakp6Wnwa%2Bx2GaimqqUlsCptcCnZKCZmaOypXnEsZicrJyuenV8jKWZrGWUqr%2BqusZmamaoopq0r63NnKCeq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
