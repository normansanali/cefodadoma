He anticipated the store will shut its doors at the end of January or beginning of February.</p><p>Texas-based Pier 1 Imports, a home furnishings and decor retail company, recently announced the closure of 70 stores nationwide — including one at Kapolei Commons on Oahu — as it faced a drop in sales. Media reports indicated that the number could grow as talks of a potential bankruptcy filing emerged.</p><p>Most stores in Hawaii, though, thought they would be saved.

We do pretty well in Hawaii.”</p><p>Guillermo said headquarters didn’t specify reasons for cutting Hawaii stores. Because Pier 1 also is shuttering all Alaska locations, some local staff assumed that noncontiguous U.S. closures will help curb increasing shipping costs.</p><p><span class=quotations>“I think it’s just going to help save the company hopefully,”</span> Guillermo said. <span class=quotations>“I hope it doesn’t go into bankruptcy.”</span></p><p>Shoppers Tuesday were befuddled when learning of the store’s liquidation, which had markdowns of up to 30 percent.</p><img width=600 height=484 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2019/12/04060435/kcd-pier-1-chang.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>Rachel Chang of Kahului said decor is difficult to find on Maui, and Pier 1 Imports has been one of her go-to spots for unique finds. She was “depressed” by news of the store closure and joked about how the sadness made it difficult to shop.</p><p><span class=quotations>“I was surprised,”</span> said Eric Arbogast, owner of Cuatro Restaurant in Kihei. <span class=quotations>“I had no idea what was going on until I walked in just now.”</span></p><p>The Wailuku resident said that since his eatery opened a decade ago, he’s used Pier 1 candle votives, plates, glasses, bowls and other dishware because it’s <span class=quotations>“unique”</span> and <span class=quotations>“not generic.”</span></p><p><span class=quotations>“They have really cool stuff,”</span> he said.</p><p>Debbie Walsh of Pukalani said she also was surprised but added that shopping is quickly evolving due to online purchasing.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Who would have ever thought that stores would become obsolete but that’s where it’s heading,”</span> she said. <span class=quotations>“It’s kind of scary.”</span></p><p>Longtime shopper Chang, a Kahului resident, said she was shocked and saddened about the news.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Every year I get something new from Pier 1 — I guess next year it’s not going to happen,”</span> she said. <span class=quotations>“I’m happy I’m getting things on sale, but I’m not happy they’re closing.”</span></p><p>The closure information about a week ago also came as a surprise at the Kahului store, which opened in October 1999 and currently has about 15 employees. Some staff members work once a month and many have five to six shifts per week, Guillermo said.</p><p><span class=quotations>“There was a lot of disbelief,”</span> he said. <span class=quotations>“Everyone thought we would move to a different location because of the status of Maui Marketplace — it’s a ghost town here. We didn’t think we would be affected by this raft of closures.”</span></p><p>Maui Marketplace off Dairy Road, once bustling with retail giants Borders Books & Music, Sports Authority and Lowe’s, has seen significant vacancies since 2011.</p><p>Guillermo said Pier 1 employees <span class=quotations>“appreciate the community”</span> and called frequent clients, such as interior designers, condo managers and restaurants owners, to share the sad news and encourage them to come in and get what they could.</p><p>Three inventory shipments still will come in and stock from the local warehouse will be sold as well, store officials said.</p><p><span class=quotations>“I encourage everyone to come by at least once a week to check out the new promotionals and sales they’re pushing to get stuff out of the store,”</span> Guillermo said. <span class=quotations>“Eventually, we will sell everything.”</span></p><p>Hawaii’s Pier 1 stores include Oahu’s three locations in Honolulu, Pearl City and Kapolei; Big Island’s two in Hilo and Kona; Kauai’s single spot in Lihue. Hawaii store locations are no longer listed on the Pier 1 website.</p><p>The Maui News reached out to Pier 1 Imports corporate offices for information on Maui’s closure but received no reply Tuesday.</p><p>* Kehaulani Cerizo can be reached at kcerizo@mauinews.com.</p><p>Today's breaking news and more in your inbox</p><a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a><p>The Maui News Maui County Department of Finance Director Scott Teruya was placed on administrative leave on last ...</p><a href=#></a><p>Holy Innocents Episcopal Church, formerly on Front Street in Lahaina Town and destroyed by the fire, announced the ...</p><a href=#></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3UoqWer6NjsLC5jqecsKtfobykrctmpZ6vo2R%2FcX2YaGhrZ5uWtba41KJkqaGVp3pyecCmpqefXajBosDEsKCdnV2YubC%2F1KucrGdhZX1x</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
