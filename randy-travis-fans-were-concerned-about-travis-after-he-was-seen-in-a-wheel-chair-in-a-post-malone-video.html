Although the actual cause has yet to be disclosed, it may be presumed that the wheelchair is the result of a stroke that Travis sustained in 2013. Travis was sent to the hospital in July 2013 for viral cardiomyopathy as a result of a viral upper respiratory infection. He subsequently had a stroke and needed surgery to relieve the strain on his brain. Travis awoke after surgery a few days later, though, with his heart beating without the assistance of equipment.</p><p>He proceeded to a physical treatment center after being released, but despite therapy, he suffered from aphasia. As a consequence, he had to use a cane for a while. He could walk a bit by November 2014. Although he has remained primarily wheelchair-bound since the stroke, he has gained the capacity to walk small distances over the years.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Randy-Travis-1.jpg alt="Randy Travis" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Randy‚Äôs wife Mary spoke to Rolling Stone in 2021 about her husband‚Äôs stroke and how she was not prepared to accept that her husband would be bedridden for the rest of his life. Randy‚Äôs recuperation included many ups and downs, according to her.</p><h2>Who Is Randy Travis?</h2><p>Randy Travis was rejected by numerous record companies in the early phases of his career, and his demo recordings were heavily criticized. He then went on to play at The Nashville Palace as Randy Ray. In 1982, he released an independent album called Live at the Nashville Palace, which helped him get a contract with Warner Bros Records.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Randy-Travis-2.jpg alt="Randy Travis" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Travis recorded roughly 20 albums and 50 singles over his career.
