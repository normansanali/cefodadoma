Which again, the protocol is to make sure those doors are working and…to have a conductor to be looking out the window. Or some instances, we have CCTV for the conductor, so he or she can look up.”</p><p>Police said his left arm was severed, and his left leg was partially severed.</p><p>He was rushed to Maimonides Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.</p><p>The investigation is ongoing.</p><p>Copyright © 2022 WABC-TV.
