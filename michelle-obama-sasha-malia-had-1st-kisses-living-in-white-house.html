That doesn’t have anything to do with you. Take your butt to school. Yes, you have security, just ignore them, they’re not here for you. Your goal is to go to school, come back, get some decent grades. Don’t act up. Don’t embarrass us.’”</p><p>Since the end of her father’s presidency, Malia, 21, has been attending Harvard University.
