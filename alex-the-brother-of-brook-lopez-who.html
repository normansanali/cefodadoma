During his two years of college basketball, he played for the Stanford Cardinal. In the 2008 NBA Draft, Lopez was taken by the New Jersey Nets with the 10th overall pick.

Information About Brook’s Siblings</span></h2><p>One of Brook Lopez’s brothers is named Alex. In the world of basketball, people are familiar with the Lopez brothers. There are two other siblings in the Lopez family besides Brook and his other twin, Robin, who also hold NBA positions.</p><p>For example, the only Lopez brothers still competing in the NBA are Brook and Robin Lopez, despite having been the league’s stalwarts for more than ten years. Before going pro overseas, Alex played basketball for Washington and Santa Clara in college. He was unable to play in the NBA, though.</p><h2><span id=Who_Are_Brook_Lopez8217s_Siblings>Who Are Brook Lopez’s Siblings?</span></h2><p>Despite being active in sports at a young age, Chris, Brook Lopez’s other sibling, never made it to the NBA.</p><p>Robin, the second twin, is just as well-known as Brook. Both brothers attended San Joaquin Memorial High School and the Elite Basketball Organization AAU club.</p><p>As a result, they were accepted into Stanford. A minute older than Robin, Brook averaged 16 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 1.1 assists per game in his two seasons at Stanford.</p><p>Despite not having produced earth-shattering stats in college, both athletes were selected in the first round of the 2008 NBA Draft. Robin was selected by the Suns at selection number 15, five choices after Brook, who was selected by the Nets at pick number 10 overall.</p><h2><span id=Discover_Brook_Lopez8217s_Nationality_and_Ethnicity_Meet_His_Family>Discover Brook Lopez’s Nationality and Ethnicity; Meet His Family</span></h2><p>Brook is an American with mixed ancestry who was born in the Los Angeles suburb of North Hollywood to Deborah Ledford and his father, Heriberto Lopez, who is now estranged and of Cuban descent.</p><p>However, the brothers’ father, a former baseball player, passed on a sporty gene to them. It’s safe to say that his children were enthralled by his athletic career. Marcelino Lopez, Heriberto’s cousin, had also played baseball in Cuba and had pitched for a few Major League teams.</p><p>He left his native Cuba, where he worked, and moved to the North Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles.When Alex was in the second grade, the family later moved from North Hollywood to Oak Harbor, Washington, to be closer to his brother.</p><p>The couple has four sons: Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, Alex Lopez, and Chris Lopez. Heriberto encouraged his sons to participate in sports while they were young. According to rumors, Brook’s parents are divorced, and he has lost contact with his father. Brook and Robin subsequently became professionals and are currently NBA basketball players. Brook was chosen for the NBA All-Rookie team in 2008-2009.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Concetta Monti</a>, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Chani Natasha</a>, and <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Peachprc</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Basketball Player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Is Zach Bryan Gay?
