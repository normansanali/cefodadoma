She also held my baby shower for Lil’ Hank which is something I will always be thankful for.&nbsp;She was a wonderful person and I wouldn’t be the person I am without her,” Kendra concluded.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>It’s clear that Mary will be <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>missed by friends, family</a>, fans and <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>.</p><h3>WATCH: Hugh Hefner’s Secretary, Mary O’Connor, On ‘Girls Next Door’</h3><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h3>— Chris Rogers</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8><a class=twitter-follow-button href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Follow<br>@ChrisRogers86</a><br><strong>More On Mary O’Connor, Hugh Hefner’s Beloved Secretary:</strong></p><li>Mary O’Connor: Photos Of Hugh Hefner’s Late Secretary</li><li><a href=#>Mary O’Connor’s Death — Bridget Marquardt On Hugh Hefner Secretary’s Passing</a></li><li><a href=#>Mary O’Connor Dead — Hugh Hefner’s Secretary From ‘Girls Next Door’ Dies</a></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWljZH1ye5JqZqaZoq56sK%2FOp6Woql2ZsqKwjKScp5yilnq4tcukoKern6N6o7jOoGSompmpwqK%2B2GanpZmpl7y6ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
