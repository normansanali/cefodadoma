Source: InstagramThe channel Fox News has seen plenty of turnover and turmoil in recent history, which is why it wasn't a huge surprise when Fox & Friends Weekend co-host, Jedediah Bila, announced she was leaving. Jedediah, who started off as a teacher, slowly transitioned into TV when she was asked to provide her political point of view on a handful of shows."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Jedediah, who started off as a teacher, slowly transitioned into TV when she was asked to provide her political point of view on a handful of shows. In 2013, she joined Fox as a contributor, but was later recruited by <a href=#>The View</a>, which she hosted for its 20th season.</p><p>Fox hired Jedediah in April 2019, and she officially became the co-host of Fox & Friends Weekend. On May 22, 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> reported that Jedediah was leaving not just Fox & Friends Weekend, but the network entirely. This led to many questions and opinions from fans, viewers, and bystanders alike.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Why did Jedediah Bila leave Fox News?</h2><p>According to Fox News, Jedediah Bila's departure from the network was an amicable decision.</p><p>"We have mutually and amicably parted ways with Jedediah Bila and wish her all the best. The new co-host of Fox & Friends Weekend will be named soon," the network announced.</p><p>The former Fox & Friends Weekend co-host gave a similarly positive update on the situation, letting people know that she's "excited for what's to come."</p><p>"Thank you to the Fox News reporters, anchors, contributors, and producers who have been an absolute pleasure to work with these last few years. To the viewers who supported me throughout my journey there — I'm deeply grateful for you and hopeful you'll join me on my next adventure," Jedediah wrote.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/qqQqUipFyO</a></p>— Jedediah Bila (@JedediahBila) <a href=#>May 21, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">So, what's Jedidiah doing next?</h2><p>So, what is next for Jedediah? Well,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to her website</a>, she has a second book coming out in November 2021. Her first book,&nbsp;#DoNotDisturb: How I Ghosted My Cell Phone to Take Back My Life,&nbsp;came out in 2018. It's unclear if the TV personality will head over to a different network at this time.</p><p>On April 1, 2021, Jedediah posted a photo of herself on her laptop, with the caption, "Working on a new project. One that makes my heart smile." The former co-host is also a mom who shares 1-year-old son Hartley Luca with her husband, Jeremy Scher.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newsweek</a> reports that her upcoming book will be titled Dear Hartley, Letters to My Son, and detail her experiences about motherhood.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jedediah Bila (@jedediahbila)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Some Fox News viewers felt like Jedediah had "changed" and wasn't right for the network anymore. "So Jedediah Bila is OUT at @FoxNews it seemed to me & the bosses at @FoxNews she CHANGED during the pandemic. She got angry at the World. I used to like her. But I saw HATE & frustration in her on-air work. I hope she gets the job she really wants," one person tweeted.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So Jedediah Bila is OUT at <a href=#>@FoxNews</a> it seemed to me & the bosses at <a href=#>@FoxNews</a> she CHANGED during the pandemic.

Back in April 2020, Jedediah <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">publicly criticized Donald Trump</a> for attacking Chris Wallace (who had discussed Trump not acting on COVID-19 sooner).&nbsp;This wouldn't be the last time she criticized Donald Trump's behavior.</p><p>"Enough with the third grade name-calling. Chris is doing his job. The news should not be any president’s friend, ally, or buddy. If it bothered you when Obama complained about Fox News, but you’re silent on this complete nonsense, then just stop. Seriously. Enough," Jedediah, who had tested positive for COVID-19 herself, tweeted.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Enough with the 3rd grade name-calling. Chris is doing his job.

It’s going to fall on him. With great power comes great responsibility to say, ‘You know what? The process is done. This is the verdict. Let’s move on.'"</p><p>It hasn't been confirmed at this time whether or not Jedediah's political views were a catalyst for her leaving Fox & Friends Weekend. "I'm proud of you for just being honest. The pressure must have been enormous and it couldn't have been easy. I hope I'd have the strength to do the same," one person tweeted.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm proud of you for just being honest.
