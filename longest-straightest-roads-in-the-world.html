Here we round up the stretches of tarmac that barely require a touch of the steering wheel.</p><h3>The longest straight road in Britain</h3><p>That would be the A15 between Scampton and the M180, lasting for about 18 miles with barely a wobble through the Lincolnshire countryside. Exotic.</p><h3>The longest straight road in Europe</h3><p>The Corso Francia pierces Turin like a lance, jutting out to the west of the Italian city, but is only 7.3 miles. The road was built at the nod of Vittorio Amedeo II of Savoy in 1711, beginning at the Piazza Statuto, ending at the Martyrs of Liberty Square in Rivoli.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The glittering lights of Turin</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Fotolia/AP</span></figure><h3>The longest straight road in the world</h3><p>Highway 10 has the dubious honour of boasting the longest straight section of road in the world and, judging by Google Earth, the most boring. The 162-mile stretch from Haradh to the border is straighter than Bud Abbott. Given the featureless desert either side, you might have trouble keeping your eyes open, but at least you'll struggle to crash into anything.</p><h3>The most famous straight road in the world</h3><p>“Australia’s longest straight road” proclaims the sign at the beginning of of the Eyre Highway on the nation’s south coast. Motorists completing the whole length will endure 90 miles without a single deviation.</p><h3>The flattest straight road</h3><p>Interstate 80 crosses the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, which, as the name suggests, are as flat as the road is straight. The road itself bisects the United States, from New York to California, but its journey through Utah is what excites drivers who hate steering. It’s not all boredom though - the road passes the 87-foot sculpture, Metaphor: The Tree of Utah.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>As flat as it is straight</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Getty</span></figure><h3>The straightest road in North America</h3><p>North Dakota claims its Highway 46 is the longest straight road in the US and Canada. Slight bends aside, the motorway boasts a 31-mile dead straight stretch from Gackle to Beaver Greek. However, the aforementioned Bonneville Salt Flat road is meant to be longer, at 35 miles.</p><h3>The straightest road that visits the most states</h3><p>Behold the US Route 54, reaching from El Paso, Texas, to Griggsville, Illinois. Along the way, it enjoys a Bible-straight section that features two state lines, gracing Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.</p><h3>The oldest straight road in the world</h3><p>It’s not straight by modern standards, but the Appian Way was the original straight road. Connecting Rome to Brindisi, the Appian Way was named after Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman censor who began and completed the first section in 312BC. In 71 BC, 6,000 of Spartacus’s slave army were crucified along the Via Appia from Rome to Capua.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The Appian Way, the original straight road</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Getty</span></figure><p><i>If you like straight roads, maybe you'll enjoy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this comprehensive list of the world's most remote roads</a>.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKyilsOmuI6loKyso2S5sLrGnqqtZaOpv6K1xqGrnqukYr%2BwrcOsZKKmXam1pnnWqKmlnF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
