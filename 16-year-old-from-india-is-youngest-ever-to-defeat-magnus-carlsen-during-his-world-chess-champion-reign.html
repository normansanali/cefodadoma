In 39 moves, Pragg stood victorious over Carlsen in the Airthings Masters online rapid chess tournament.</span></p><p><span>Before the two players went into battle, Carlsen had already won three games in a row, while Pragg finished Day 1 of the tournament with three straight losses, according to </span><span>CNN</span><span>. On Sunday, he bounced back and shocked viewers with his victory over the Norwegian five-time World Chess Champion.</span></p><p><span>“I’m just really happy,” Pragg said in an interview with </span><span>Chess24</span><span>. “I think yesterday wasn’t so good. Today, I think my play was much better, so I hope this continues for the next two days.”</span></p><p></p><span>Pragg’s victory also made him the third Indian grandmaster to win against Carlsen after grandmasters Viswanathan Anand and Pentala Harikrishna, according to CNN. He also became the youngest international master at the age of 10 in 2016.</span><p><span>When asked about his victory celebration, Pragg noted the time difference and said, “It’s about time to go to bed, as I don’t think I will have dinner at 2:30 in the morning.”</span></p><p><span>Defeated player Carlsen attributed his blunders to the lingering effects of COVID-19. He had reportedly tested positive before the tournament, according to </span><span>NPR</span><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It’s been pretty bad. I played a couple of decent games, but the rest of them have been poor. I need to do a lot better than that,” Carlsen said, according to the </span><span>International Chess Federation</span><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It’s been a little bit better today, but the first couple of days I was feeling like I’m OK, but I didn’t have the energy, which made it hard to focus because every time I tried to think I blundered,” he added. “It was a little bit better today, but still pretty bad.”</span></p><p><span>Featured Images via </span><span>chess24.5</span><span> (left), </span><span>chess24</span><span> (right)</span></p><h3>Support our Journalism with a Contribution</h3><p>Many people might not know this, but despite our large and loyal following which we are immensely grateful for, NextShark is still a small bootstrapped startup that runs on no outside funding or loans.</p><p>Everything you see today is built on the backs of warriors who have sacrificed opportunities to help give Asians all over the world a bigger voice.</p><p>However, we still face many trials and tribulations in our industry, from figuring out the most sustainable business model for independent media companies to facing the current COVID-19 pandemic decimating advertising revenues across the board.</p><p>We hope you consider making a contribution so we can continue to provide you with quality content that informs, educates and inspires the Asian community.<br><span class=donate_way><strong>Even a $1 contribution goes a long way.</strong></span> Thank you for everyone’s support.
