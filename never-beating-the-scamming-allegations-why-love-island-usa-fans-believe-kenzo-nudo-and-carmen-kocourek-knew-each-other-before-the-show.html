Kocourek entertained several conversations with Casa Amor bombshell <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Rausch</a>, who expressed that he was developing feelings for her, but their connection wasn’t enough to stop Kocourek from sleeping on her own outside or from returning to the villa alone to recouple with Nudo.</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=709 data-injectable=true>In fact, their bond has appeared so strong that many fans have been speculating that the couple may have known each other before going into the villa. Some eagle-eyed fans have even pointed out that their paths may have crossed before as they both hail from Scottsdale, Arizona, and possibly attended the same gym.</p><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=150 data-injectable=false>Nudo is from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, although he lives in Scottsdale, Arizona, while Kocourek is a Wisconsin native but lives in Scottsdale as well.</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>One fan wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter) on August 4, “Chiii I just found out Kenzo & Carmen knew each other prior love island and they even went to the same gym.. this season is so problematic.” They accompanied their tweet with two photos showing Nudo and Kocourek both at 5 Star Fitness​ in Scottsdale, Arizona. A search of both reality stars’ <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram pages</a> showed that they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">both went to that gym</a> at some point.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Chiii I just found out Kenzo & Carmen knew each other prior love island and they even went to the same gym.. this season is so problematic <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zoXoOTd6pP</a></p>— ? stacia ? (@etherealharlott) <a href=#>August 5, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=636 data-current-count=936 data-injectable=true>After the 27th episode aired on August 15 showing the couple making their relationship official, fans flooded social media with reactions. “Kenzo wants Carmen to be his girlfriend already? I smell something…… IT SMELLS LIKE SCAMMERS TO ME! #LoveIslandUSA,” one <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">commenter wrote</a>. “We live down the street from eachother, in the same small town, we so happen to go to the same gym, and we have to same trainer, im so surprised we don’t know eachother’ kenzo and carmen please…” someone else <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>. Another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>, “Yeaahhh, Carmen and Kenzo are never beating the scamming allegations…”</p><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>The speculation got so severe on social media that Nudo’s brother posted a statement on the Love Island star’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> page denying that the two knew each other. “I’ve been seeing the rumors about Kenzo and Carmen knowing each other before getting on Love Island and how they worked out at the same gym with a trainer is all nonsense,” the statement said in part. “Kenzo never knew Carmen prior to the show and he stopped going to that gym months before, Kenzo also doesn’t have a trainer.”</p><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>Kocourek and Nudo’s former Love Island USA co-star Emily Chavez — who was eliminated alongside Harrison Luna — also defended the couple on her social media. In response to a commenter who wrote that Nudo and Kocourek should have been the ones eliminated instead of her because they knew each other, Chavez <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>, “No they don’t people are making stuff up, everyone better leave my girl Carmen alone!!!”</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>The 27th episode of Love Island USA season 5 ended in the middle of movie night for the cast, so viewers will have to tune in when the show resumes on August 17 to find out whether clips of Nudo or Kocourek will air and throw a wrench in their blossoming relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e82erZ6qXZeyosDIp55mrJiaerSvwKakoqaXYq6tuMSgmK2hn6PAbsPHsmSlp6aaeqq%2Fy5qlnWWlqK5ussCnqmaalaG2psLEZqKepqqkeq%2FBw6hkmqaUYrCivsyepWajn5i8tr7EpGSkppWseqatwqFkqKyYmr9ursSfpqudXam1pnnSoaawZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
