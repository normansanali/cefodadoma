Despite working adults soldiering through the day-to-day, there‚Äôs still something magical about those long, hot afternoons, something that reeks of nostalgia for those days long gone when we had few to no responsibilities and months to go before the school year reared its ugly head.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>To inspire that potentially long-lost sense of wonder, we‚Äôve gathered a set of memes to help remind you of that sense of happiness and to promote good vibes going into the hottest months of the year. From students and teachers to parents and those who are child free, we‚Äôve got some good summer vibes for everybody in these celebratory memes.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>Even the best of years can be tumultuous for students. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to let kids unwind over the summer and digest some of the hard learned lesson from the year. And let‚Äôs be honest, sometimes it‚Äôs just easier to let them make their own mistakes and learn from the outcomes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>It's been a rough year for all of us parents. Let's just try to get through this summer with a little bit of humor üòÅü§¶ <a href=#>#summerbreak</a> <a href=#>#kidmemes</a> <a href=#>#parentingmemes</a> <a href=#>#illallowit</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YtDY856pm2</a></p>‚Äî Northland Radiology (@NorthlandRadio2) <a href=#>June 21, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true>Let‚Äôs be honest, one of the best things about summer is making plans that you never follow through on. Sometimes the heat just won‚Äôt allow for those afternoon romps, or maybe you want a moment to focus on self-care? Either way, the days of summer seem to stretch forever, and we all deserve a little break from the pressure, right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.weareteachers.com/wp-content/uploads/doing-nothing-over-summer-meme-800x800.png><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>Some of us have incredible AC, but for the rest of us, nights can be a battle all on their own. On those hot nights, the best we can do is try to hold on and hope that we finally get the rest we need.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/736x/4d/f5/c6/4df5c680492f0eabc3814e4b91c9076b.jpg><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>One of the best things you can do on vacation is take a nap. Few things beat the glory of knowing you can doze off for a while without having any responsibilities sneaking up on you. Just make sure you‚Äôre wearing sunscreen if you plan to snooze outside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/zxkjmdZ.jpeg><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true>No matter how close you are to your family, or how sociable you are, we all reach a point of no return when it comes to socializing. With the copious number of family BBQs, reunions, and sporting events, there‚Äôs no doubt that some of those limits strike when you‚Äôre with the ones you love the most.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/tZKqXuK.jpeg><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>But the best thing about those family reunions are the tiny new additions to the family! Summer is so much more fun when you‚Äôre experiencing it with a little one. Sometimes, we just need to take a minute and channel our inner child and try to experience the wonder of summer for the first time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/0kzKw2H.png><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>Its almost impossible to say no to the idea of a summer meal on a patio. No matter how hard you might be trying to watch your figure‚Äîyou look great by the way‚Äî or your wallet, the sirens call of a cool breeze, the open sky, and some good company is well worth letting go of the little things for a day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/BIq4IS8.jpeg><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=655 data-injectable=true>For many of us that final day of school before summer vacation may be a distant memory, but the sheer joy of knowing that you won‚Äôt have to come back for a while can still be found in the lead up to a vacation. There is nothing quite like the sense of weightlessness that comes with knowing that tomorrow, everything is someone else‚Äôs problem.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/eG5qyBV.jpeg><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>The last thing you want while on vacation is to be bombarded by messages from coworkers. For our own mental health, it‚Äôs a good stance to refuse contact. The next time you get to go out of town for a while, channel Ron Swanson. Don‚Äôt pick up that phone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/rYzZ64l.jpeg><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>There are countless jokes about needing a vacation from your vacation, and the struggle is real! If you‚Äôre anything like me, it can take days before your brain reactivates and sets itself back into work mode. Remember to take it easy on yourself and that no one is 100% efficient all the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/7Nk8wIC.jpeg><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8cnyMrKympZWneq6xzJ6qZqiVp7Omr9NmnaiqXai1or7Ip55mn5%2BksW7CyJucrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
