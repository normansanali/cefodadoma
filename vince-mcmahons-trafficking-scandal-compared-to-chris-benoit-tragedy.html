After all, he killed his wife and child before committing suicide in 2007 – something that no one can forgive.</p><p>While speaking on <a href=#>Story Time with Dutch Mantell</a>, Dutch Mantell discussed the possibility of WWE erasing Vince McMahon from its history, similar to what was done with Chris Benoit.</p><p>Dutch Mantell stated that WWE could definitely do the same thing to Vince McMahon that they did to Chris Benoit, but added that McMahon’s scandal is bigger than Benoit’s tragedy.</p><p>“They can, really. For years and years and years, he [Vince McMahon] was all over it [WWE television], so I don’t know how they could erase him. I mean, they could, but they’d have to get somebody to say a voiceover. They’d have to get that erased, and it’d be a lot of trouble. This is the biggest story I think wrestling has had ever. I don’t think the Chris Benoit story was this big.”</p><p><a href=#>WWE is also reportedly attempting to remove Vince McMahon from the WWE 2K24</a>&nbsp;video game and it is unlikely fans will see him back in WWE, which might be the best course of order now.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What do you think of this story?
