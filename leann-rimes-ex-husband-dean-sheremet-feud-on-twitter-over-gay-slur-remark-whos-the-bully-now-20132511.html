The &#34;Spitfire&#34; singer, 31, seems to be constantly embroiled in a war of words with someone on the micro-blogging site — often her husband's ex-wife Brandi Glanville — and she got into it again on Nov. 23, this time with her own ex, Dean Sheremet. See more pics of LeAnn Rimes here.
The latest drama started when Twitter user Da Giggle Factory tweeted an old photo of the country star along with the caption, &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But Sheremet, married to photographer Sarah Silver, didn't think the quip was so funny.</p><p>"Laugh away — Who's the bully now?" the dancer-turned-chef <a href=#>tweeted</a> at Rimes, whom he divorced in 2010 after eight years of marriage. "I don't do Twitter wars, but I do hate ignorance. Being gay isn't offensive, not standing up for the truth is."</p><p>That prompted a response from another Twitter user, who defended Rimes' earlier comment about choosing to laugh at the original post. "Exactly, dear lord. I was laughing at myself," the singer <a href=#>clarified</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She also emphasized her strong ties to the gay community. "No, [Dean's] not gay and there's nothing wrong [with] it," she <a href=#>tweeted</a>. "I have always & will always support the community."</p><p>Sheremet, who does charity work with Wellness in the Schools, tells <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> he was upset not that someone said he was gay but that it was perceived as an insult — and that Rimes didn't say otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>"What I was offended by was someone using the term gay as a slur and her not defending it," the food blogger (and Thanksgiving Good Day L.A. guest host) told <strong>Us</strong>. "I don't care about me. I've learned not to take things personally. This was out of respect to my many gay friends and fans."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalnZGju26%2ByKacrGWVrXqpwdKbmKecXZmyorqMrJ%2BeqpWisrV5xZ6snWWfo3q1w8itq56qXaTDpr6MoJiyZaOhwrN50Z6kmqqbYsSpu9Jmq6GdXZfCrbjYZqWor11nfXJ%2FkW5oamc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
