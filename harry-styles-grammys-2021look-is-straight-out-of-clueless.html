Known for embracing gender-fluid fashion, the One Direction alum wore head-to-toe Gucci, including a yellow plaid blazer that served up major Cher Horowitz vibes.</p><p class=p1>The 27-year-old pop star is never one to leave out a wow factor when it comes to his clothing choices, so it’s no surprise that he paired the jacket with a V-neck sweater, brown velvet pants and a purple boa.</p><p class=p1>Obviously, the internet had a lot to say about this look. Aside from the undeniable Cher Horowitz comparison though, fans were quick to point out that Styles may have taken a nod from yet another iconic celebrity look.</p><p class=p1>The outfit in question? <a href=#><strong>Ashley Tisdale</strong></a> at the Princess Diaries 2 premiere in the early 2000s. While the High School Musical star has come out and said that the pink look was not one of her finest fashion choices, Styles may beg to differ.</p><p class=p1>His boa look awfully familiar to the pink one she sported way back when. <a href=#>One twitter user</a> posted a side-by-side of the two, noting that Tisdale is “the influencer” and Styles is “the influenced.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The “Adore You” singer continued to serve up some strong style moments as the night went on, wearing another Gucci ensemble for his on-stage performance.

I hope we did this with the mix of the tweed and the boa, [which is] Britishness, rock ’n’ roll and camp all rolled into one.”</p><p class=p3><span class=s1>The “Golden” vocalist was nominated for three Grammys: </span><span class=s2>Best Pop Vocal Album (Fine Line), Best Pop Solo Performance (“Watermelon Sugar”) and Best Music Video (“Adore You”).
