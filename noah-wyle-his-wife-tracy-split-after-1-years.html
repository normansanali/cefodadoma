So it’s just sad to hear that Noah and his wife Tracy have split up, and are already in “a mediation process” which I think is a fancy way of saying “divorce”. Noah and Tracy had been together 10 years, having met on the set of The Myth of Fingerprints, when Tracy did his makeup. They have a son, Owen, age 7, and daughter Auden, age 4. I love the name “Auden” by the way. That’s so pretty.</p><p>Noah Wyle and his wife, Tracy, have separated after 11 years of marriage, the actor’s rep tells PEOPLE.</p><p>“Tracy Wyle and Noah Wyle, who separated in late October 2009, have confirmed they have entered into a mediation process,” rep Eddie Michaels announced in a statement on the couple’s behalf. “Neither has legally filed for divorce. Tracy and Noah live in separate residences; however their two children (Owen, 7, and Auden, 4) see both parents daily.”</p><p>Wyle, best known as John Carter from NBC’s hit ER, married makeup artist Tracy Warbin in 1998 after the couple met on the set of Myth of Fingerprints.</p><p>Says a friend of the couple: “They’re cooperative with each other and have put the interests of their children ahead of anything else.”</p><p>Wyle recently wrapped a TNT pilot for a sci-fi show, co-produced by Steven Spielberg and DreamWorks Television.</p><p>[From <a href=#>People</a>]</p><p>Just to see if there was anything juicy about this split (another woman, another man, some kind of farm animal), I did the necessary googling, but the Wyles seem clean as a whistle. And you know someone is squeaky-clean if the Internet is quiet about it! So, what broke them up? I have no idea, truly. Am I a bad person for feeling slightly turned on that Noah is back on the market? He’s so cute! I love how he’s rocking all of this facial hair too – he has such a baby face, anything to help him look older.</p><p>Noah Wyle, alone, walking in LA on January 8, 2010.
