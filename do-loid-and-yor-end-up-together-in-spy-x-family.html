What draws viewers in, in particular, is the “will they, won’t they?” trap that Loid and Yor are in.</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>Though the two are legally married, they have only done so for convenience, using the made-up family to throw off suspicion regarding their jobs as a spy and an assassin. There’s no doubt that Spy x Family fans are hoping for Anya’s adoptive parents to get together eventually. After all, who doesn’t enjoy a good love story?&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=543 data-injectable=true>With the anime only in its first season, viewers wonder what’s in store for these two. Among all of the trials and tribulations of their respective jobs, will Yor and Loid ultimately fall in love?</p><p data-characters=15 data-current-count=15 data-injectable=false><strong>Spoilers ahead.</strong></p><h2 id=h-do-loid-and-yor-get-together data-injectable=false>Do Loid and Yor get together?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/yor-loid-spy-x-family.jpg><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>At the moment, Yor and Loid are not in a relationship — they haven’t even kissed yet. The manga is still ongoing, however, so there is still room for the pair’s relationship to develop into a romance and it’s not far-fetched to imagine the story is headed that way.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>Over the course of the series, there are some instances that hint at the characters’ growing feelings for each other, like the frequent blushing when they are complimenting each other as well as all the romantic situations they keep finding themselves in.</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>With Yor, this is a little more obvious, particularly when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fiona Frost</a> comes into the picture, making Yor double down on her insecurities. As we know, Yor has always worried about not being a good enough wife to Loid or a good mother to Anya, and upon meeting Fiona, she can’t help but think that the spy is better suited for the role. Loid and Fiona’s apparent closeness certainly doesn’t help matters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/48F500D2-77B0-4B61-AE7B-56CB5913A429.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/8A55C5C6-3AD0-49DB-8935-BFBEEDE0FC05.png><h2 id=h-how-do-loid-and-yor-actually-feel-about-each-other data-injectable=false>How do Loid and Yor actually feel about each other?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/spyxfamily.jpg><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true>As for Loid, determining his feelings isn’t so straightforward. The spy tends to have a good grip on his emotions and is often too preoccupied with missions to ponder over the simpler things in life. While he’s likely not aware of his own attachment yet, other people seem to be clueing in, like Fiona, who promptly notices how happy and relaxed Loid seems with his newly created family.</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>This stirs up some jealousy within Fiona, due to her feelings for Loid, which poses the question: why would a love rival be introduced to the story if its intention isn’t to drive Loid and Yor’s relationship forward?</p><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>Although there is no guarantee that these characters will end up together, everything seems to point in that direction.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=false>Those who are on the edge of their seats to find out what comes of Loid and Yor’s relationship are in luck. It has been confirmed that season 2 will be released on Saturday, October 7!
