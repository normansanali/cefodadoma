She told him:</p><p>I was different. I got picked on a lot in high school and for just some reason I felt inadequate. This is hard for me.</p><p>She clicked with 27-year-old general manager Damian and he offered her the support she needed in this vulnerable moment.</p><p>Giannina works as a small business owner, however it has yet to be uncovered what that business is. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>One source</span></a> suggested her business is in retail, which would make sense considering her career in fashion.&nbsp;When she‚Äôs not running her business, Giannina also works as a model, which she was more than happy to talk about on the Netflix show.</p><ul><li><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>TRUTH TALKING</span></a>:</strong> Is Netflix‚Äôs Love is Blind fake?</li></ul><h3>Damian and Giannina on Love is Blind</h3><p>Giannina was open with Damian about her trouble in past relationships.</p><p>In the second episode, she admitted: ‚ÄúI self-sabotage all the time. But I realise that I do it when something that‚Äôs too good to be true is happening to me because my parents divorce really f***ed me up‚Ä¶ this is something that I‚Äôve always been afraid of.‚Äù</p><p>But her hesitance did not stop Damian and Giannina from jumping into the engagement head first. In fact, seconds after Damian proposed to Giannina, she proposed right back melting all of our hearts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto aria-describedby=caption-attachment-73350 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-18-at-15.16.38.png alt width=1146 height=665 sizes="(max-width: 1146px) 100vw, 1146px">Screenshot: Love is Blind S1 E3 ‚Äì Netflix<h3>Are Damian and Giannina still together?</h3><p>Yes!</p><p>Things did not look good for the couple from the looks of the second instalment of episodes, which dropped on Thursday, February 20th.&nbsp;Damian and Giannina struggled to communicate with one another and were frustrated in each other‚Äôs company, particularly when around the other couples.</p><p>In fact, they had a full-blown argument in episode 6, just over the way Damian had interacted with Lauren Speed.&nbsp;It hit its peak when Damian said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bringing me down,‚Äù which Giannina then threw back at him and then called him a ‚Äúmotherf***er.‚Äù</p><p>And while they had a dramatic end to their relationship, where Damian decided not to marry Giannina at the altar, the couple are still together!</p><p>In the reunion episode, they revealed that they were still dating much to all of our surprise. When asked if they were together, Giannina said:</p><p>We are so together. Like every single day waking up together, going to the gym together. I don‚Äôt want to lose this. I just don‚Äôt. And I didn‚Äôt.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Damian and Giannina ended up staying together <a href=#>#loveisblindReunion</a> <a href=#>#loveisblind</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Tffkwi0HRL</a></p><p>‚Äî SimiüíÆ| (@maggiesxrose) <a href=#>March 5, 2020</a></p></figure>View Tweet<h3>Follow Giannina on Instagram</h3><p>Thanks to her career as a model and appearance on Love is Blind, Giannina‚Äôs Instagram following has rocketed.
