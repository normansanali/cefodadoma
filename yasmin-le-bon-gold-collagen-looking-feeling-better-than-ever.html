Yasmin wore an outfit from Benetton which was the only store she could get to.&nbsp;</p><p id=egtI4DuucL_ data-wc=62>As parents to Amber, 34, Saffron, 32, and Tallulah, 29, their daughters are still frequent visitors to the couple’s double-fronted home in Putney, London, and Saffron lives with her partner and their two children, Taro and Skye, in a cottage next door.

A cup of tea in bed would be nice, and maybe a trip to the Royal Academy of Arts. I’d really love to do something or learn something new. Maybe finally do a pottery class!&nbsp;</p><p id=eEtt5Rtz9PER data-wc=66>“I don’t think I care as much about what people think about me. I now realise that the world doesn’t revolve around me and I like that. I like being able to stand back and have some perspective on life. I also think I have become so much funnier. I obviously spend way too much time with my family, but honestly, I laugh all the time.&nbsp;</p><p id=eQOXtXdXXb3q data-wc=63>&nbsp;<strong>“</strong>Every year has been a blessing. I have great friends and great family, and I keep telling myself it’s all about the process. I had my spotlight moment from a very young age, but as you learn more and experience more you become better at what you do. I always felt really happy that I’ve never stopped working and have kept myself busy.</p><p id=eBR9hgMJ9FXc data-wc=60>“On the one hand, I’m amazed that I’ve made it this far. On the other hand – what on earth have I been doing? Get a move on, girl! Now is the time to say yes. You have to make an effort to be part of the wider world, to be open in your heart and mind to new ideas.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d0759976a679-yasmin-le-bon-3.jpg><h3><strong>Yasmin Le Bon on her wellness routine</strong></h3><p id=e4pejDSvubEf data-wc=48>With glowing skin, glossy hair and a seemingly ageless appearance, Yasmin is as in demand now as she was in her twenties.

Tons of herbal tea, and yes, I am on HRT.&nbsp;</p><p id=e4i82hbZm0xZ data-wc=64>“I think it is important to enjoy exercise but it shouldn’t be a chore. You want to keep yourself in good shape. I train a couple of times a week with my fabulous trainer who has helped me through back issues. I go to the gym and am out with the dog, but I can’t push myself in the same way I used to.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a41cc003327b-240412ehyasminlebongc07017.jpg><p id=eDOBa3zYcTyo data-wc=31>“I train for a short time and it’s mostly about muscle tone. I couldn’t function without seeing my physiotherapist every couple of weeks. It’s all about maintenance rather than fighting fires.&nbsp;</p><p id=eeiVuDzlZwHJ data-wc=42>“I start every day with a probiotic drink, as gut health is crucial. I’m trying to eat more protein, I love all green vegetables and I love wine – but I’m not sure it loves me as much as it used to.&nbsp;</p><p id=edXP6CIVmUFa data-wc=25>“I take various supplements
