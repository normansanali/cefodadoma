There have been many similar startups that came and went over the past couple of decades, with but a small percentage actually succeeding and staying in business. With the IceSLEET G6 Stealth, Iceberg Thermal is boldly challenging the top players of the PC cooling market, trying to establish a reputation with enthusiasts and other performance users.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/17608/ICEBERG_THERMAL_ICESLEET_G6_STEALTH_car_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The quality of the IceSLEET G6 Stealth is impeccable. No matter how closely one examines the cooler, there is not a single weak point, a bent fin, or a flaw on the plating. The mechanical strength of the cooler is excellent and, in combination with the plating, it ensures that the cooler will be unscathed by the passage of time and multiple installations/removals. It would be extremely difficult to mechanically damage this cooler – only the fan may fail after several years of use but any quality 140 mm fan can easily replace it if that happens.</p><p>When it comes to performance, the IceSLEET G6 Stealth does not disappoint either. The company’s marketing efforts are not hollow, as the cooler’s noise figures are exceptionally low. Under normal operating circumstances, the IceSLEET G6 Stealth should be practically inaudible, even with the system under load if it is called to cool a mainstream CPU operating at stock frequency. The design and colossal proportions of the cooler allow for the handling of extreme thermal loads with relatively little airflow, placing the IceSLEET G6 Stealth among the first slots of our performance charts.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/17608/ICEBERG_THERMAL_ICESLEET_G6_STEALTH_10_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The Iceberg Thermal IceSLEET G6 Stealth is a strong contender for one of the best CPU air coolers ever made. Nevertheless, it is not without flaws. The massive size of the cooler necessitates a very roomy case and we're concerned that its hefty weight could easily cause damage to the motherboard if the case is to be transported. Its size also means it will almost certainly cover some of the RAM slots – the clearance of 56 mm will allow for some RAM modules to fit but there still is some compatibility risk with high-performance RAM modules, plus it will prevent the installation/removal of the RAM modules while the cooler itself is installed. Such flaws are not unforeseen for any tower cooler that large and are relatively minor for most system builders, but these are factors that need to be assessed nonetheless. Otherwise, the retail price of <a href=#>$80</a> is a bit steep but we believe it to be fair considering the quality, performance, and sheer mass of the cooler.</p><p>In summary, the IceSLEET G6 Stealth is an excellent top-tier air cooler, designed for top-of-the-line thermal and acoustics performance. For a product from a small company that's still working to make its name in the packed cooling industry, Iceberg's towering cooler makes a very big and very good impression.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH54go9xZq2glWK2pLHBnqmgZaSdsrO5wKVkopuVqLmmsdNmnm9lo6myorjToWSrnaaesrh7kw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
