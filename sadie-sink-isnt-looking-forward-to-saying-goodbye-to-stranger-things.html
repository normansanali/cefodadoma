To have to say goodbye to a show that birthed your career is brutal on its own, but in Sink’s case, it’s like leaving a family behind.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Today</a>, Sink lamented the incoming departure, noting how the cast and creatives of the Stranger Things team were a great source of security for her, but nevertheless acknowledging that the next chapter of her career is an exciting development in its own right.</p><p>It’s going to be awful. It’s going to be horrible. These kids, this entire cast and crew, this is like — I mean, it’s family. People say it all the time, but I genuinely mean it. And to think that we have to kind of say goodbye to that security and knowing that we won’t be seeing each other for another season, it’s scary and sad, but I think it’s exciting to move on to the next chapter.</p><p data-characters=532 data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true>Sink isn’t the only one looking forward to what she does next. Her Stranger Things co-star Winona Ryder declared last year that Sink <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">would be this era’s Meryl Streep</a>, which easily hovers around the highest praise you can possibly receive as a young actress. And while the sentiment is an entirely agreeable one, it’s just as safe to say that Sink’s talent will go on to transcend comparisons to more journeyed stars. 40 years from now, a young actress is going to be dubbed “the next Sadie Sink.”</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>Stranger Things 5 is reportedly looking at a 2024 release date. In the meantime, you can catch Sink’s evocative performance in Darren Aronofsky’s The Whale, which is currently playing in theaters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TAorDInmSsoZ6geqq%2Fza1kpaefoLavs4yfpquvkaexbsDOZqqasZmjtG6zzqibm7GVYsGwedKtqZqml5q%2FbsDHoqWgq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
