“I see you four girls right there, I hope you having a good time,” Drake, 30, said onstage at one of his European concerts, taking special notice of some ladies toward the front."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, he then added,&nbsp;“You got on that hot a** scarf right there, you might want to take this off. You don’t need to come out with that s***.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>The women he was speaking to were reportedly Muslim, so it obviously would be incredibly offensive for him to ask them to take off their traditional garb. However, keep in mind, this video from so far away gives no confirmation of what the fans looked like or what they were wearing, so this could all be a miscommunication.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Plus, an insider tells&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY: “Every ngiht, Drake speaks to the audience and points members of the audience out. There is completely no chance he would have called out girls in this manner.”</p><h3>Drake & Jennifer Lopez — PICS</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Still, that didn’t stop the Internet from blowing up at Drizzy, with many even slamming him as a racist. “How f***ing rude,” one commenter wrote on Twitter. Another added, “A da** shame.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>However, there were also plenty of people in Drake’s corner. “I don’t think the girls were wearing a Hijab,” one person wrote. “They had neck scarfs on, that explains why he was saying ‘hot’ as in “it’s too hot to be wearing scarfs.” Why would he call a Hijab ‘hot’ as in sexy? It makes no sense. Use your brain, kids.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think Drake was really speaking to Muslim women in this concert speech? What do you think of his comments?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH1ze49yZp2qkaCybr7AnKCsrF2iwrS4yKZkn5meYrWqtsCbZKybkaezbq%2FOp5qeqqRiw6qwxKhm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
