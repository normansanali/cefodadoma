Despite looking svelte and toned, the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills reality star revealed to <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> she feels "out of shape" at the moment.</p><p>"I've done Pilates for three days a week for the past 10 years," Glanville told <strong>Us</strong> of how she keeps in shape. Adding, however, "for the past two months I've skipped it because I've been moving. So I feel super out of shape right now."&nbsp;</p><p>Glanville also shared she wasn't "100% confident" with her fans on Instagram, posting an image of herself along with the caption: "I did get in my bikini at TAO But with my moving so much I've been missing work out so I wasn't 100% confident!"</p><p>The Bravo star, 41, was recently under fire after <a href=#>posting a photo</a> of her two sons, <strong>Mason</strong>, 11, and <strong>Jake</strong>, 7, in their underwear on Instagram. After Twitter users deemed the picture "inappropriate," Glavnille took to the social media site to <a href=#>defend herself</a>. "They both were clothed from waist down whatever! I was naked my whole life," Glanville wrote. "#f–koffhaters."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Glanville told <strong>Us</strong> that when it comes to her sons, they are growing up too fast for her liking.</p><p>"Letting Mason, my oldest, go away to sleep-away camp was a big deal for me," the blonde told <strong>Us</strong>. "It was two days too long and for the first time I was like really heartbroken. Like really heartbroken. You can't call them. You can only write them letters … I'm just not ready for him to grow up. He's eleven but going on like twenty."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGabqpGjsap5xqWYp66ZobmmedaemKurXamyprrYZpmio5mjtm6%2FwLKqZquYmsBuu9StZKieXai1orzEZmlpaWRmgXh7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
