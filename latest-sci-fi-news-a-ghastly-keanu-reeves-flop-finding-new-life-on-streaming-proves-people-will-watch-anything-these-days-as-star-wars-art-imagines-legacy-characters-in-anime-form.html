Even Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is a fan of the Rogue One spinoff, calling it “everything Star Wars could be” without a cameo from “a digital Luke Skywalker.” Unsurprisingly, he really appreciated Andor focusing on the political side of things in the galaxy far, far away, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">but fans are nevertheless praising him for his good taste</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Here’s what the original Star Wars cast could look like as anime characters</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/nfh1no3m0g7a1-1.jpg><p data-characters=553 data-current-count=853 data-injectable=true>As a sci-fi soap opera that borders on fantasy more often than not, Star Wars is the perfect story for the anime medium. Since all we’re getting from Disney at the moment is the Visions series, which showcases different art styles and even more absurd storylines only inspired by looks of the galaxy far, far away, fans are taking matters into their own hand <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">by imagining what some of our legacy characters like Luke, Han, Leia, and Ben Kenobi would look like</a> in anime form. As you may have guessed, the result is absolutely spectacular to behold.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>This Keanu Reeves movie has no saving grace, except for the fact that it stars Keanu Reeves</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-day-the-earth-stood-still.jpg><p data-characters=672 data-current-count=972 data-injectable=false>Due to its working model, streaming platforms have slowly turned into the perfect place for box office flops or critically panned movies to find new recognition. In the case of The Day the Earth Stood Still, we’re dealing with a film that nobody would care to watch twice, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">except for the fact that it stars Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly</a> as an alien messenger and a human astrobiologist, respectively. As far as Hollywood pairings go, you won’t find a more intriguing duo, but can we heap the same sort of praise on the movie as well? I guess you’re going to have to learn that for yourself if you decide to catch it on either Prime Video or HBO Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoo5qslajBbr%2FComSfoV2jsri%2FjJpkoKCRqMGtxYyknJqmpWK%2FprHVnqpmnpykvW6yyKeboqaXYrumw4yloJ%2BdXaS7br%2FTq5yapZmjtG680aitnqtdpbKwvMueZLChnKF6uK3TnJ9mmZ6uwam1zaBkraCVqLJusMCyqmaZo2LAta3RZq6aqqNirrPAjKKkmp%2BZo7K0ecuenpqbqWKwqa3RmpqtnaKoeqq6jJqloqWVYrOwvsxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
