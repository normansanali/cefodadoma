This one comes from ancient history, so take it with a grain of salt. Worse, it comes from Herodotus, who was a notoriously unreliable narrator who never let the truth get in the way of a good story. According to Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BC, Babylonian girls were married off in annual auctions, with potential husbands bidding for them sight-unseen.
Herodotus was writing in an age before anyone discovered hurt feelings, so he was pretty much free to describe the process accurately."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Each year, he wrote, all of a village’s prettiest and ugliest unmarried girls would be brought together. The bidding would start with the prettiest girls being sold to the highest bidders, with progressively less attractive girls fetching lower and lower prices.</p><p>After the pretty ones were all married off, the auctioneer would bring up the ugly girls and ask who would take them for a small dowry. The dowry got larger and larger as the girls got less and less desirable, with the money coming out of the previous bidders’ bride prices.</p><p>In this way, the wealth of the village would be spread around, every girl caught a husband, and everybody got something fun to gossip over for a few weeks as every woman in town shared her opinion of which girls were really worth what price.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyjtdmaqaudXZ3Crq3NZqSarJmjtG6%2ByK2smqSjZIA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
