Elliott says they learned a lot in their time with the promotion, including how to always bet on themselves.</p><p>“I learned to always bet on yourself. When I first got to the Performance Center, I was just a no-name indie wrestler that WWE saw something in. When I started training at the Performance Center, I realized that not that this journey’s easy, but I made it happen, and if I wanted to become successful, I had to stand out. The Performance Center really taught me to believe in myself and have confidence.”</p><p>Elliott was released by WWE in September. They told Mitchell about the reaction to getting future endeavored, as well as their next moves in wrestling.</p><p>“To be honest with you, I sat through so many releases, it wasn’t something that shocked me by any means. It’s not something that necessarily hurts. It hurt because it was a dream of mine, but in the moment I felt like let me make moves and become an even bigger star than I was when I was in the WWE. I took it more as a shot on the chin, and I’m not the one who just dwells on things. I’m appreciative I got to show the world myself, but now I get to show the world myself with no rules, restrictions, or handcuffs. I now get to be the Quincy I always wanted to be.”</p><h2 id=h-what-s-next>What’s next?</h2><p>Does Quincy have any future goals or opponents in mind?</p><p>“There’s plenty of things I want to do. I won’t say them all, because I want the world to be shocked. But, I want to do more than just wrestling. I’m a very creative individual, I like to create art, and you’ll get to see me in everything I want to do, whether that’s making films or music. As far as wrestling goes, there’s a lot I’d like to do in the Indies. I feel like the indies are missing that spark that they had prior to WWE and AEW doing their thing. I feel like right now I’m in a position where people can use me, and I can try to get the most buzz that I can. Honestly, I’d love to perform overseas, that’s something I never got to do.”</p><p>Quincy Elliott made their in-ring debut for NXT in March 2022 on NXT Level Up. Elliott made a handful of appearances on NXT and Level Up before going on a months-long hiatus.</p><p>Elliott&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said they were medically cleared</a>&nbsp;to wrestle in December 2022, but did not share the reason for the hiatus. Elliott’s last televised match in WWE was a tag team loss with Jiro to Hank Walker and Tank Ledger on the July 21 episode of NXT Level Up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqbG1oZ2K%2BtrXNnLBmnZyhtrDA02aaqKWdmru1v4yopWavp5p6s7HLnpisnQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
