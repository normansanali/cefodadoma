In an interview with Screen Rant Plus, he says he’s going to make some new friends.</p><p>He&nbsp;stated, “this was something I was considering. Stig, for one thing, does not primarily speak English. He moves to a new country, loses all of his friends, and is forced to live with the new boyfriend of the girl he had a crush on.”</p><p>When I see that, I think to myself, “Thank God his sister came.”</p><p>“He needed a reminder of who he was because he had completely lost track of himself when he was popular.</p><p>I believe it will be beneficial for Stig to try to make friends the right way, for who he is rather than just because he is the new guy. I really want that [for him]; he’s very special to me.”</p><p>Let’s watch the new season on Netflix to learn more about the story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutdJmo66jlWKyqr%2FNnqlmoJWetKnAjJqqZqyRoblus8iro2ZqXaW%2FprnInqmsZZ%2Bjeq%2Bx05%2BjorBdmbymv4yhnGaZnKi8brTAr5xmmV2ctrO4xaugnqaUYraveZFpaWtlY2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
