Podcasts are often celebrated for their capacity to dive deep, whether it’s a searching interview that gets stronger as it goes, a conversation that builds upon itself, or an investigative narrative that leaves no stone unturned.

Good thing not all great podcasts play the long game. Below, you’ll find a list of short podcasts worthy of your time. I’m classifying “short podcasts” as shows whose average episode lengths fall under 25 minutes. That’s a bit of a soft threshold, though it’s meant to be a proxy for shows that feel bite-sized, flow breezily, and wrap tightly. Let’s get to it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-269c7885b475fe3d5a4e6c2683739380-4-0-0@published data-word-count=75><a href=#><b><i>Why Oh Why?</i> </b></a><b>(Culture/Sociology)</b><br>Andrea Silenzi, the host and creator of this bizarre podcast, is a genius of the cringe. Her show interrogates romance and human relationships in the digital age, but it does so in a manner that defies shape and form — rapidly shifting between and mixing fiction, interview, memoir, and nonfiction narrative. Silenzi is a dogged social anthropologist, obsessively digging away at the particulars of what makes us tick as companionship-seeking animals.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-269c7885b475fe3d5a4e6c2683739380-5-0-0@published data-word-count=8>Don’t miss: “<a href=#>The Single Straight Guy Focus Group</a>”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-269c7885b475fe3d5a4e6c2683739380-6-0-0@published data-word-count=84><a href=#><b><i>Home of the Brave</i> </b></a><b>(Documentary)</b><br>A collection of postcards from the edge of the world. With each episode, Peabody-award-winning author and radio producer Scott Carrier sketches out scenes from places that are confusing, troubling, or simply forgotten: the Syrian refugee trail, a string of burnt churches across the South, the political conventions.

(Okay, sometimes it’s dialogue.) James Urbaniak is a wonderful performer, and the monologues, crafted by what appears to be a rotating stable of writers, are taut, daring experiments in structure.

A small sample: the idea that we might be close to discovering all the dunks that are humanly possible, the hunt for video evidence of the first dunk in women’s basketball, the influence of Vince Carter in Canadian basketball.
