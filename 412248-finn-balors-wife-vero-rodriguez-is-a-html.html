The athlete sometimes shares it with his wife, sports journalist Vero Rodríguez.</p><p class=dh>The couple kept their relationship under wraps and only went Instagram official months before tying the knot. However, they'd previously had public interactions in professional settings and on social media.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>A Glimpse into Vero Rodríguez's Rise to Sportscasting</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Rodríguez grew up in Mexico, where her father often took her to watch Pumas games. She developed a love for soccer, which branched out to other sports as she grew older. When she was studying at University, she had a classmate who produced a show called "Pumas TV."</p><p class=dh>He invited her to do the interviews in exchange for tickets, and that's how her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://espanol.wwe.com/article/wwe-saturday-night>career in sports TV</a> began. Rodríguez still does interviews, but another part of her work she enjoys is the thrill of her onscreen debates with her colleagues at Fox Sports.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Vero Rodríguez Has Mixed Feelings about Being in The Limelight</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Regarding being well-known in the industry, Rodríguez confessed she felt excitement and anxiety. Like many celebrities, she encounters numerous stories about herself online.</p><p class=dh>"I have a lot of anxiety, so I always wish they had written something good about me [...]. Every time I see that they have published something about me, I have a few five seconds of anxiety," she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://bolavip.com/concacaf/Vero-Rodriguez-Me-considero-una-de-las-figuras-mas-completas-del-periodismo-deportivo-20200424-0048.html>shared</a> as translated.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Vero Rodríguez's Romance and Marriage with Finn Bálor</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>It's unclear when Rodríguez and Bálor began dating, but the couple's earliest known interactions date back to 2017, when Rodríguez <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/FOXSportsMX/status/847892554473492483>interviewed the WWE star</a> upon his return to the ring and again when she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/verockstar/status/898627567522938880>did the #FinnFreeze</a> with him that year.</p><p class=dh>Bálor and Rodríguez also interacted frequently on X (formerly Twitter). In May 2019, Bálor posted a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/FinnBalor/status/1123667406994509825>single crying emoji</a>, and Rodríguez <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/verockstar/status/1123681959538982913>responded</a>, "90 minutes left," with the fingers crossed and the fire extinguisher emojis.</p><p class=dh>The following day, Rodríguez updated her followers, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/verockstar/status/1123948249264656384>writing</a> (per Google translate), "We are back in @AgendaFOXSports, and it has me in extreme happiness." Bálor replied with a donut emoji, to which Rodríguez responded with a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/verockstar/status/1123972015680040960>steaming bowl of soup</a>.</p><p class=dh>A few days later, Rodríguez shared <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/verockstar/status/1126322275240894475>a mirror selfie</a>, to which Bálor <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/FinnBalor/status/1126432535024738304>replied</a>, "Estas en uno ('you are in one,' per Google translate)." Two months after these random posts — the context of which is a bit of a mystery — in June 2019, they went Instagram official.</p><p class=dh>They each shared <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B1w-ETmhUGR/>a few photos</a> from their special day on socials. They have bonded over their shared love for WWE, but when asked about her favorite wrestlers, Rodríguez only listed <a class="me a" href=#>Roman Reigns</a> and AJ Styles, among others. However, this was before she and Bálor went public.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1oa2pkbXqntc2nZJuZnKS%2FtHnWop2eZaaav7B50aibq6GXqrK7ecisZJpmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
