While in New York City earlier this week, the supermodel was spotted wearing a Penny Lane coat. The sheepskin style is straight out of the '70s, although there's a turn-of-the-millennium angle here, too: It's named after Kate Hudson's rock-chick character in Almost Famous, which came out in—you guessed it—the year 2000."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She kept the rest of her outfit simple: a classic black turtleneck, a pair of straight-leg jeans in a dark wash, and black square-toed leather boots. For accessories, she wore her signature narrow sunglasses (this time with what seems to be a dark-purple tint) and a few amber-colored rings.</p><img alt="01242022 exclusive bella hadid picks up some flowers and brings them to her sister, gigi's house in new york city the 25 year old supermodel wore a patterned trench coat, dark jeans, and black heels video availablesalestheimagedirectcom please bylinetheimagedirectcomexclusive please email salestheimagedirectcom for fees before use" title="EXCLUSIVE: Bella Hadid Picks Up Some Flowers and Brings Them to Gigi's House in New York City.

That night, the model seemed to again find style inspiration from the '70s. She wore a chocolate-hued minidress featuring a plunging neckline and a high-low hem. Accessories included a notably more '60s pair of white go-go boots, a cheetah-print shoulder bag, a pair of hoop earrings, and gold nameplate necklaces.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hadid talked about her love of dressing up in a 2018 interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/models/a16750739/bella-hadid-bvlgari-billboard-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=BAZAAR.com class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">BAZAAR.com</a>. "Even when I was a kid in high school, style was always my thing. I never wore flip-flops, I always had my cute outfits, I went vintage shopping," she said at the time. "It's crazy because I was never one to put outfits together for people to see me, but now of course I walk outside and photographers are outside my apartment. So now it's a fun thing. I look at it, instead of being like f— this, I can show what I'm really made of."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
