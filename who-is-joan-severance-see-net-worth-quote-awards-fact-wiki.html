Her career has been active since the late 1980s.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Joan Severance is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources it has been estimated that Severance’s net worth is as high as $6 million, an amount earned largely through her successful careers.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=joan-severance-net-worth-6-million></span>Joan Severance Net Worth $6 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Joan is the daughter of Martha and John C. Severance; her father held a position at IBM, and because of his work profile, he and the family moved a lot in Joan’s early years. In one of the interviews, she stated that she was a resident of 12 different places by the time she turned 11, including Libya. She went to Westbury High School, and before matriculation became interested in modeling, as she wanted to start earning some money for college. Little by little, her face and name became more recognized, and as a result she was introduced to John Casablancas, who got her a contract with the Elite modeling agency; soon she flew to Paris, where her career got off to a successful start.</p><p>While in Paris, she made appearances in such magazines as Sportswear International and Vogue Paris, and then returned to the US, and made more than 40 commercials before retiring as a model, but using her profile, Joan began auditioning for small acting roles.</p><p>Eventually Joan landed the role of Susan Profitt in the TV series “Wiseguy” (1988), and the following year she starred with Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder in the comedy “See No Evil. Hear No Evil”, followed in the same year by appearing next with Hulk Hogan in “No Holds Barred”. She started the ’90s with a role in the thriller “Write to Kill” (1991), and in 1993 starred in the romantic drama “Lake Consequence” with Billy Zane. Throughout the ‘90s Joan made numerous appearances in mostly romantic drama films, and thrillers such as “The Last Seduction II” in 1999, among many others, all of which increased her wealth.</p><p>Joan continued in the same way in the new millennium; in 2001 she featured in the mystery thriller “Cause of Death”, and later starred in the romantic thriller “Last Sunset” (2006). From 2006 until 2007 she portrayed Anna Whitman in the TV series “Wicked Wicked Games”, further increasing her net worth. However, then her career started to decline, and didn’t make any more notable appearances until 2016, with the role of Sandy Byers in the film “Accidentally Engaged”. Most recently, she appeared in the film “The Wandering Day” (2016), and will feature in the film “Becker’s Farm”, which is yet to be released.</p><p>Regarding her personal life, Joan was married to model Eric Milan from 1977 until 1984, since when she has been single..</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Joan Severance</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$6 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 23, 1958</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>February 7, 2008, Moscow Oblast, Russia</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Houston, Texas, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5′ 9″ (1.75 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress, Producer</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Westbury High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Eric Milan (m. 1977–1984), Rom Gemar</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Vladimir Severin</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>John Severance, Martha Severance</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/Joan.Severance</td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn</td><td>https://www.linkedin.com/in/joan-severance-76817a55</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000220/</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Sex & Consequences, Black Scorpion, No Holds Barred, Criminal Passion, The Runestone, Payback, In Dark Places, Bird on a Wire, Dangerous Indiscretion, The Last Seduction II, Criminal Intent, Almost Pregnant, Black Scorpion II, Frequent Flyer, Another Pair of Aces, Matter o…</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Love Boat: The Next Wave, Wicked Wicked Games</td></tr></table><table class=quotes><tr><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Wearing this kind of costume is not something I fantasize about.
