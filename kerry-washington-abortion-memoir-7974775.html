"At first, I wasn't really sure how it fit into this story of my life. But I started to feel like it was really important for me to share this.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Amanda Edwards/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Washington wrote in her memoir that she gave a false name to her doctors in order to protect her privacy during the early days of her career when getting the procedure done, explaining to People that “this story had so much to do with my understanding of myself and the world as my career unfolded."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress added, "It's just so important to me that abortion is not a bad word, and that my abortion is not another thing on the list of things that I'm ashamed of. We're at a moment where it's really important to be telling the truth about our reproductive choices because some of those choices are being stripped away from us."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kerry, who now shares two children and one step-child with husband Nnamdi Asomugha, also explained that she hopes sharing her story will help other women feel less “shame” surrounding the topic of abortion: "I'm telling my truth about my life, excavating some of my secrets," she shared. "I don't want my not telling it to make anybody think there is shame to be had."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yp6pq7FdrK60tMinnq2nnmKuo7vRraCopl2isq67yKtkcHFnaYR4gQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
