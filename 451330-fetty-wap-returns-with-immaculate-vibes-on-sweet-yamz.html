Today, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Fetty Wap</a> was able to come through for those fans with a new song called "Sweet Yamz."</p><p>NEWARK, NEW JERSEY - AUGUST 26: Fetty Wap attends the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards at Prudential Center on August 26, 2019 in Newark, New Jersey.

As Fetty explained, “I really connected with the original song ‘Yamz’ from the first time I heard it earlier this year. It makes me think of one of my favorite cities, Miami. I immediately knew I wanted to flip it and had to do a Zoomix!”</p><p>The song has an undeniable vibe to it. If you are a fan of the artist, then you are likely to appreciate what he's doing here. Fetty Wap has a knack for melodies, and that certainly comes through in this brand-new effort.</p><p>You can check out the new song, down below.
