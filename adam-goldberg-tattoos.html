It was when people were making the switch to CDs. I just went in deep.”</p><p>In fact, his love for one of those artists even had a detrimental influence on his academic record. “I like to cite the fact that I was up one night spinning Art Tatum records or something like that into the wee hours the first time I took the SATs,” he said. “I just did miserably. I also had a NyQuil problem, and I remember being very sleepy, during that particular exam. [Laughs] I underachieved quite extraordinarily on that exam.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He says his tattoo artist, Mark Mahoney, is a “scholar of the medium.”</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>As he served as guest editor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnet Magazine</a> in 2011, Adam wrote an ode to tattoo artist Mark Mahoney of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shamrock Social Club</a> in Hollywood, Calif., explaining that Mark is the reason he has so many tattoos.</p><p>“Were it not for Mark, it simply wouldn’t be,” he added. “I wanted to own his art, and it’s the only art he sells. Brilliant, fine-line work. A scholar of the medium, of art itself, of architecture, design, clothes, music, speak and all that is cool. … Mark is a muse of mine who himself is far more talented an artist than any interpreter or documentarian could do justice.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And Adam isn’t Mark’s only celebrity fan. The Hollywood Reporter calls Mark the “high priest of Hollywood tattoo artists,” noting that he has done ink for <a href=#>David Beckham</a>, <a href=#>Johnny Depp</a>, <a href=#>Adele</a>, <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>, Rihanna, Jared Leto and Lana Del Rey. (Lana even cast Mark in two of her music videos.)</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He once considered becoming a tattooist himself.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Talking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brightest Young Things</a> in 2018, Adam said he “went through a brief phase” of trying to learn tattooing. “And this is just incredibly ironic, because I’m a horrible drawer,” he added. “If you saw my penmanship… I mean, if I was some really important person, and my journals were left behind, it’d take some kind of code-breaking linguist to figure out what the hell I’m writing.”</p><p>The actor even talked to Mark about opening a place together before he realized that tattooing is not for him, as he said in the interview. “My wife [creative director and illustrator Roxanne Daner] is an incredible artist, but if I even trace something, and it comes out looking remotely like something that isn’t abstract expressionist, then I’m shocked.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrGiuYygpqWckpq%2FqHnTmqutp5%2Bo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
