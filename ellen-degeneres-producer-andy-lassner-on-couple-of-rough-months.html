If it isn’t Andy Lassner. Well, yes, it is. Your eyes do not deceive you,” the 53-year-old said in an <a href=#>Instagram</a> video on Sunday, August 30. “I’m back. I’ve been away for a little bit dealing with, you know, some stuff. You may have read about it. It’s been a couple of rough months.”</p><p>He continued, “But it’s when we go through these things, I guess, that we learn the most about ourselves and maybe even some growth. But to tell you it hasn’t been rough would be a lie, and I’ve always been honest with you. So, it’s been rough. But I’m back. … I love you guys. I miss you. And I’ll talk to you soon.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ellen-DeGeneres-Show-Executive-Producer-Andy-Lassner-Returns-to-Instagram-2.jpg><p>Lassner has largely stayed out of the spotlight since <a href=#>WarnerMedia launched an internal investigation</a> into <a href=#><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a>’ talk show on July 27 over current and former staffers’ <a href=#>allegations of racism, fear, intimidation</a> and <a href=#>sexual misconduct</a>.</p><p>Lassner and fellow executive producers <strong>Ed Glavin </strong>and<strong> Mary Connelly</strong> said in a joint statement to BuzzFeed News at the time that they were “truly heartbroken and sorry to learn that even one person in our production family has had a negative experience.” Glavin and two more producers, <strong>Jonathan Norman </strong>and<strong> Kevin Leman</strong>, <a href=#>have since been ousted</a> from the Emmy-winning series.</p><p>DeGeneres, 62, <a href=#>apologized to her staff</a> in a letter on July 30, writing in part, “On day one of our show, I told everyone in our first meeting that The Ellen DeGeneres Show would be a place of happiness — no one would ever raise their voice, and everyone would be treated with respect. Obviously, something changed, and I am disappointed to learn that this has not been the case. And for that, I am sorry. Anyone who knows me knows it’s the opposite of what I believe and what I hoped for our show.”</p><p>Nearly three weeks later, the host and her producers held a video meeting with employees that “really boosted morale,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly on August 17.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ellen-DeGeneres-Show-Executive-Producer-Andy-Lassner-Returns-to-Instagram.jpg><p>“She said she’s not on set as much as everyone else, and she didn’t know what was going on,” the source said. “Ellen said she was <a href=#>ashamed and embarrassed to hear about it</a> and assured them it would not continue. … She said if you heard anything about the show not coming back, that’s not true.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Amid the backlash, DeGeneres has received support from her wife, <a href=#><strong>Portia de Rossi</strong></a>, and celebrity friends including <a href=#><strong>Katy Perry</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kevin Hart</strong></a>.</p><p>“They know that Ellen can be tough but <a href=#>accept that about her</a> and know that it takes a lot of work to run a tight ship like her show,” a second insider told Us in August. “They get it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaepJyau26wxKCcp52imsBuvNGom66blad6orrDsmSlmaOou6a%2BjKilZpufqr2tsYyonWaqn6q0qXnMqKWtoKNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
