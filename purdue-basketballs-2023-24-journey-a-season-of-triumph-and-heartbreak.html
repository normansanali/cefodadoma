Try as they might, the Boilermakers stood no chance against UConn's sheer rule of force, eventually falling 75-60. Zach Edey with 37pts was impressive, but not enough to win the title.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1><strong>The Aftermath</strong></h2><p>Being beaten by the Huskies had a lifelong effect on the team, and they struggled for years with dashed hopes of achieving that ultimate victory. Not to mention following the "championship or bust" set by the team showed resilience and expectation that colored their path.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Looking Ahead</h2><p>In the aftermath of 2023-24, Purdue Basketball finds itself at a fork in the road, one that offers an opportunity to build on what was and a moment to draw wisdom from the agony of loss.
