Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham were then asked to join by Fleetwood. Fleetwood Mac’s later commercial success, particularly the well-known album Rumours, was greatly influenced by Buckingham and Nicks, while the band’s longevity was largely down to Fleetwood’s own commitment to keeping the band together. In addition, Fleetwood has had a successful solo career, written books, and dabbled in acting.</p><h2>Is Mick Fleetwood Still Alive?</h2><p>Yes, Mick Fleetwood is alive and strong in his 75th year. In London, Fleetwood settled after deciding at the age of 15 to follow his musical interests. There, he co-founded Fleetwood Mac with Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer, and Bob Brunning.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYrqqr8pmnaWdlanEsLvDZqqtoZyheqK4yK%2BcaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
