Forget fancy car services, taxis and Ubers — when it comes to getting around a city or going from point A to point B, plenty of celebrities use their own two legs to bicycle through the streets.
Some celebs — including Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux and Pippa Middleton — pedal their way through traffic on busy streets as a green means of transportation. Others — we’re looking at you, Hugh Jackman and Seal — may grab a helmet and ride their bikes through parks, go off-roading on mountain trails or cycle down suburban roads."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Forget fancy car services, taxis and Ubers — when it comes to getting around a city or going from point A to point B, plenty of celebrities use their own two legs to bicycle through the streets.</p><p>Some celebs — including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Naomi Watts</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Justin Theroux</strong> </a>and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pippa Middleton</strong></a> — pedal their way through traffic on busy streets as a green means of transportation. Others — we’re looking at you, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hugh Jackman</strong></a> and <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seal</a></strong> — may grab a helmet and ride their bikes through parks, go off-roading on mountain trails or cycle down suburban roads.</p><p>But riding a push bike isn’t just a convenient — and incognito — way to get around town, it’s also great exercise. And if you’re looking to burn calories, it’s a much more affordable way to do so than attending group classes like SoulCycle or Flywheel. As a low-impact sport (unlike running), cycling is also a cardiovascular activity that’s gentle on your joints and good for any age. Case in point: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Goldie Hawn</strong></a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong></a>, both in their 70s, love to ride bikes.</p><p>And as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lea Michele</strong></a> has told Us, you don’t have to be a fitness fanatic to take a two-wheel for a spin. It can simply be a fun way to squeeze some extra movement into your day. “I have a bicycle on the Paramount lot. So I like to bike back and forth to set from my trailer, or if we have a little bit of a break, I’ll bike around the lot,” the actress shared in 2016. “That’s an easy way to keep your body moving and to keep yourself active.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Another benefit of wheeling around? It’s a good hobby to pick up with a romantic partner. “We love to do anything active and adventurous together. We go hiking and biking. We want to go rock climbing together,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Julianne Hough</strong></a> told Us in 2018 of outdoor activities she and her husband, <strong>Brooks Laich</strong>, do together. “We really just try to find as much to do as possible to stay active, to move, to get good energy flow. That’s important to us every single day.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see photos of celebrities riding in the great outdoors!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNksKa4xJupoqyZmsBuw8eoZKuhlJp6o7XCspqlnaNiwLWt0axkm6Gbmnqnu9FmnaKsnprAtHnTq5inq6Ckv7V7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
