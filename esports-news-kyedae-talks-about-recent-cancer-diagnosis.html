I’m sure a lot of you, or I’m sure some of you might know what it does to your body. And, like, I already feel quite sick,” Kyedae shared. She explained she would be unable to stream regularly due to undergoing chemotherapy. She acknowledged that the treatment was already making her feel sick and was causing health complications, which she had been experiencing for some time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>After announcing a few days ago that she was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Kyedae spoke on how she found out</p><p>She says she waited to tell her family and TenZ until after he was done with VCT São Paulo so he could focus on the tournament <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/azMIOW5hUA</a></p>— Hunter (@HUN2R) <a href=#>March 5, 2023</a></figure><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Valorant content creator Kyedae diagnosed with cancer, fans and streamers pour in recovery wishes</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Kyedae addresses the community after her diagnosis </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tenz-Kyedae.jpg><p>Kyedae informed her community that she was okay and would soon begin chemotherapy. She also made a humorous remark, followed by admitting that she had burst out laughing when she received the diagnosis.</p><p>“Health. I’m okay. I start chemotherapy very soon. So I hope I don’t die (the streamer bursts out laughing). I’m sorry, I’m so bad at this.“</p><p>Kyedae explained that she preferred to use laughter and humor as a coping mechanism, rather than succumbing to sadness. She acknowledged that she tended to make inappropriate jokes to alleviate her stress and asked for forgiveness if it triggered any of her followers.</p><p>“Let’s be real here. If I get sad and I’m just like, ‘Oh, I have cancer.’ ‘Oh this.’ Oh that.’ Like, it’s not going to go, ‘Poof! Go away.’ You know what I mean? It’s just like, my way of coping.”</p><p>She also explained how she hopes that people on the internet and around her, especially her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fiance</a>, TenZ, don’t treat her differently after this news.</p><p>“Like, that’s all I can hope for, and honestly, don’t treat me any differently. Just treat me like a normal person.”</p><p>She stated explaining she waited to tell TenZ until after he finished his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">VCT</a> Sao Paulo games. She did so that she wouldn’t take focus away from his game.</p><p>“But I didn’t tell anyone actually. Not even my mom or my dad, or Tyson, until after his tournament.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-react-to-kyedae-s-announcement><span class=ez-toc-section id=Fans_react_to_Kyedaes_announcement></span><strong>Fans react to Kyedae’s announcement</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kyedae’s followers expressed their love and support for her, and she thanked them for their kind words.
