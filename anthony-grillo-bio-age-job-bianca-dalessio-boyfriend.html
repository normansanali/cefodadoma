And in this article, we tell you everything you need to know about Anthony Grillo.</p><p>Let’s start with Selling the Hamptons. Selling the Hamptons is now available on Discovery Plus for streaming. And apparently, it is a very different show from all the other real estate reality shows on TV right now. The Hamptons real estate scene is very different from everywhere else and it is very difficult to find success for new realtors there.</p><p>And Selling the Hamptons is going to bring that side of the reality to the screen as well. Apart from Bianca, the show will also feature J.B. Andreassi, Michael Fulfree, Peggy Zabakolas, Jimmy Giugliano, <a href=#>Kenny Arias</a>, Mia Calabrese, and a few others as the cast members.</p><h3><strong>Meet Selling The Hampton Bianca D’Alessio Boyfriend, Anthony Grillo</strong></h3><p>Anthony Grillo and Bianca D’Alessio first met in 2015. Since then they have been together through thick and thin. They have had many enjoyable times, from “fancy dinners” to trips to Europe, to just being a darling couple on social media.</p><p>In social media, Bianca has called him her “motivation”. She has also mentioned that he is very supportive and that he is “absolute best”. And he does not mind her working late or on weekends and even listens when she talks about real estate all the time. According to Bianca, Anthony also makes her laugh all the time and keeps a smile on her face.</p><p>Similarly, Anthony has called Bianca an “amazing woman”, “a beautiful person in every way”, his “pea head”, “ultimate traveler”, “Lil fisherwoman”, and other names of endearment. He also said in an Instagram post that Bianca has “balanced [him] in every way”.</p><p>Furthermore, Anthony has also mentioned that Bianca deals with his “craziness” quite well. Also, the two of them travel a lot.</p><p>It is unclear whether Bianca and Anthony have tied the knot. For two people who are both quite active on social media not sharing anything about their wedding can only mean that they have not married yet. Although in 2016, they did go to a wedding as each other’s date.</p><p>Another curious thing was Anthony last appeared on Bianca’s Instagram in August 2021. Bianca posted a photo of the two of them with captions “My love” followed by a heart emoji. Anthony has not appeared on Bianca’s IG since. That makes us curious about the possibility that they might have broken up.</p><p>However, Bianca has not deleted the old photos of her and Anthony on her IG. So, it was likely that they were not broken up.</p><h3><strong>Anthony Grillo Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly, Anthony Grillo was born in the year 1990. And he turned 31 years of age in October 2021. He celebrates his birthday on the 11th of October. So, his zodiac sign is Libra.</p><p>Bianca, on the other hand, is a little younger than him. She celebrated her 25th birthday in 2017. That means, as of January 2022, she was 29 years of age.</p><h3><strong>Anthony Grillo Job</strong></h3><p>Anthony Grillo has many jobs, but all the jobs he is associated with are related to coins and metals. It is safe to say that Anthony is a coin expert. According to his Instagram bio, Anthony is the president of Westchester County Coin Club. He was elected as the president of the club in 2019 and he has held the position since.</p><p>On the occasion of his election, Anthony posted a photo with Joel Iskowitz, a legendary American Mint Engraver, and wrote, “Being elected President of the Westchester County Coin Club of New York has been a Great Honor. We had our annual Banquet on Wednesday. I invited Joel Iskowitz, US Mint Engraver to be our Guest of Honor, He spoke incredibly.”</p><p>Anthony is also a senior numismatic buyer for American Collector’s Group. According to their website, American Collector’s Group is a “company that focuses and specializes on the buy-side of the industry. Our highly trained ANA educated buyers to show a true passion for the numismatic and precious metal industry…”.</p><p>On the other hand, according to his Linkedin profile, Anthony has been working for the past 12 years as a Senior Sales Account Manager for National Collectors Mind/Stratus Com. He started that job in January 2010 and has been at it since then.
