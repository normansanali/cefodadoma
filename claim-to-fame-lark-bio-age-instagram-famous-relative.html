At the end of each episode, the contestants vote for which of the bottom two finishers will become the Guesser in the Guess-Off.</p><p>The “guesser” is selected by the contestants themselves and the selected person will choose a “guessee”. If the guesser correctly answers who the guessee’s famous relative is, then, the latter won’t be eligible to move forward in the next episode.</p><p>Otherwise, the guesser who isn’t able to name the famous relative correctly will be the one eliminated from the show.</p><p>Lark is one of the 12 contestants who appeared on the show as someone who has a famous relative.
