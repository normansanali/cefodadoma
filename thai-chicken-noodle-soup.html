I had to say goodbye to cheese, butter, bread, and ice cream and that was a BIG DEAL to me! Hello, I like to eat a cookie a day! But, I was determined to still eat flavorful food so I didn’t feel as if I was missing out.</p><p>This Thai Chicken Noodle Soup was my ticket — a soup that was not only full of nutritional benefits but tasted fabulous as well. &nbsp;I seriously drink this broth like it is going out of style. A big bowl of this Thai Chicken Noodle Soup is the epitome of comfort food.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0387-copy2.jpg alt="Thai Chicken Noodle Soup.

Red peppers, cauliflower, and rice noodles are added and cooked just until soft. It is topped with fresh cilantro and thai chilies.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0369-copy.jpg alt="Thai Chicken Noodle Soup.

You just throw the noodles into the broth which makes it so easy! Canned coconut milk adds a rich creaminess to the soup and is naturally dairy-free. &nbsp;I used the full-fat coconut milk but you can use lite coconut milk as well.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0379-copy.jpg alt="Thai Chicken Noodle Soup.
