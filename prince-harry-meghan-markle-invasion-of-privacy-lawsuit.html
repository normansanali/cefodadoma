Per the document, the photographer claims the photos in question were taken while the couple were out in public in Malibu, but Harry and Meghan confirm that Archie has not been taken anywhere outside the couple's home, let alone Malibu, since they <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a31946666/prince-harry-meghan-markle-los-angeles-move/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="moved to Los Angeles" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">moved to Los Angeles</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Based on the description of the photos, the couple believes the images were taken of Archie in their backyard, according to the filing. The documents describe the photographer's intentions as a "relentless and quite frankly shocking effort" to intrude on the privacy of a 14-month-old boy.<br></p><img alt="prince harry and meghan markle visit northern ireland" title="Prince Harry And Meghan Markle Visit Northern Ireland" width=2660 height=1918 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-visit-the-eikon-centre-and-news-photo-1595594666.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Chris Jackson</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Every individual and family member in California is guaranteed by law the right to privacy in their home. No drones, helicopters or telephoto lenses can take away that right," Kump, of Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump & Aldisert LLP, said in a statement. "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are filing this lawsuit to protect their young son’s right to privacy in their home without intrusion by photographers, and to uncover and stop those who seek to profit from these illegal actions."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though Prince Harry and Meghan Markle do not know the identity of the photographer who snapped the photos of Archie, they are hoping to uncover the person's identity by subpoenaing people who might have knowledge about the images. The couple wants the photographer and any prospective buyers to turn over all images. They're also seeking compensatory and punitive damages for the breach of privacy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Sussexes acknowledge in the lawsuit that they understand the public interest surrounding themselves, but unlike their day-to-day work, private photos of their young son "are not news. They are not in the public interest. They are harassment." The royal couple claims the photos are an attempt to "profit from a child" and the fact that the shots have already been seen by hundreds of potential buyers is "disgusting and wrong."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4daa8765-4788-452b-b976-683922ffb919_1660573271.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" title="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Bianca Betancourt is the culture editor at <a href=# rel=noopener>HarpersBAZAAR.com</a>, where she covers all things film, TV, music, and more.
