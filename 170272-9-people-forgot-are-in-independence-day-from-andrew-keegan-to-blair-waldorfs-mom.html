While Will Smith broke out as a super star after the film's release, there were so many <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>people you didn't realize were in <i>Independence Day</i></a> like teen heartthrob Andew Keegan, Randy Quaid, and <i>My So-Called Life</i> actor Devon Gummersall, actor/singer Harry Connick Jr. and many others. Since the movie deals with, you know, the entire world being threatened by alien spacecrafts, the film had an expansive cast.</p><p>The sequel <i>Independence Day: Resurgence </i>was released in theaters and continues the alien invasion story of the original film, featuring most of the original cast members like Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman. I mean, it would be hard to bring everyone back because the 1996 movie's cast was so vast and had so many recognizable actors in roles large and small. It's no wonder that the aliens were no match for the talented human (cast) back then. Although some of the actors are now well-known for other roles, they still played a part in making <i>Independence Day</i> the July 4th classic it is today.</p><p>Here are 9 people you may not have realized were in <i>Independence Day</i>.</p><h3>1. Randy Quaid</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Sometimes I feel like Quaid appeared in every single movie from the '90s. He was played a key role in <i>ID4</i> as Russell Case, who claimed to once be abducted by aliens and became a laughing stock — until he saves the world, of course.</p><h3>2. Vivica A. Fox</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>VALERIE MACON/AFP/Getty Images</p></figure><p>The now-popular movie and TV actress played Smith's love interest Jasmine, a single mom/exotic dancer who was pretty darn resourceful during an alien attack.</p><h3>3. Harvey Fierstein</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Gary Gershoff/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>The Broadway actor played Marty Gilbert, who works with David Levinson (Goldblum) at the cable company. Unfortunately, he got very trapped in a traffic jam while New York City was trying to evacuate.</p><h3>4. Kiersten Warren</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Charley Gallay/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p><i>Saved By The Bell</i> fans might recognize this actress from the series' failed spin-off <i>Saved By The Bell: The College Years</i>. <i>ID4</i> fans know her as Jasmine's friend Tiffany.</p><h3>5. Devon Gummersall</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>GABRIEL BOUYS/AFP/Getty Images</p></figure><p>After the ABC series <i>My So-Called Life</i> ended, the actor had a small role in the movie as Phillip.</p><h3>6. Dan Lauria</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Robin Marchant/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Famous for playing the dad on <i>The Wonder Years</i>, this actor played a commanding officer in <i>Independence Day</i>.</p><h3>7. Harry Connick Jr.</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Emma McIntyre/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>The singer has also become well-known for his acting roles, including <i>Independence Day</i>, where he played Captain Jimmy Wilder, a friend to Smith's Steven Hiller.</p><h3>8. Margaret Colin</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Jemal Countess/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Before she was known for her role as Blair Waldorf's mom on <i>Gossip Girl</i>, the actress played Constance Spano, the White House communications director and ex-wife to David who tries to manage the chaos.</p><h3>9. Andrew Keegan</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Marsaili McGrath/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>This <a href=# class=T3D>teen hearttrob and current religion founder</a> (yup) made an appearance in <i>Independence Day </i>as the older boy who tries to hook up with a girl as the aliens are invading.</p><p><i>Image: 20th Century Fox</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyg49rbmtlaWK9prvPpZxmnp%2BntLDAjJqpnmWZo3qqusOep56mlJq7pLGMnZiyZZanvK55wKebq52nYrimscaapWasn2Kvra3Iq2SwmZyZvLOy0makqKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
