I certainly understand,” the “XXPENSIVE” singer told the actress, 47. “It’s so cliché — you know, the younger woman, the older, wealthy man. I do find it a little interesting that it is continued because it’s a 20-year-old story for me and not for others. It’s one of those things.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Erika-Jayne-Shares-Rare-Pic-of-Son-Tommy.jpg><p>The Bravo personality went on to say that their marriage is stronger than ever while quarantining amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Tom and I spend a lot of time at the kitchen table chatting,” she explained to McCarthy. “I was gone for four months because I was in New York, doing [Chicago&nbsp;on] Broadway, and then the whole world kind of came to a screeching halt. We go to bed early, which is I know kind of lame, but in the same time kind of nice. So it’s been fun.”</p><p>The couple “have’t been ready to kill each other,” although they do “get on each other’s nerves” like all couples do, she admitted.</p><p><a href=#>Jayne previously said her sex life with Girardi was “OK”</a> in an April episode of RHOBH, telling <a href=#><strong>Garcelle Beauvais</strong></a>: “People always ask that. They’re always like, ‘What’s going on?’ Is it 20-year-old f–king all day long? No. … I’m tired of having to justify my 20-year marriage.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaeqpmgrm62wLKlnmWjna6zsdJmqZqqlWK9qq%2BMqJ1mq5%2BjerW7zKawZqiVpL2tsYysmLJlp5p6rbvOpGSapJmgsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
