Dawson, 38, donned orange shorts, a white tee and a blue button-down.</p><p>Between shots, the group laughed and relaxed together, with Styles putting on an oversize coat. Apparently, the weather was not quite as warm as their costumes made it seem.</p><p>In the 1950s-set movie, the <a href=#>former One Direction member</a> plays a gay policeman named Tom who carries on a secret relationship with museum curator Patrick (Dawson) while being married to Marion (Corrin). Based on a novel of the same name by <strong>Bethan Roberts</strong>, the film is directed by <strong>Michael Grandage</strong>, who is primarily known for his work in the theater.</p><p>Styles made his acting debut in 2017’s Dunkirk, to the delight of 1D fans everywhere. His costar <strong>Mark Rylance</strong>, an Oscar and Tony winner, said at the time that his 11-year-old niece was more impressed by his Styles connection than she had ever been by the rest of his career.</p><p>“She was just more excited than anything I’ve ever done because I was going to be acting with Harry Styles,” the actor, 61, told the <a href=#>Associated Press</a>. “I went up in her estimation.
