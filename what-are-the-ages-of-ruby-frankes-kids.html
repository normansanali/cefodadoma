Chad was often depicted as the “problem child”, and his mother took away his bedroom as punishment and forced him to sleep on a beanbag. Abby was pulled out of public school, despite expressing being happy there, after the school played the song “Apple Bottom Jeans”.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=762 data-injectable=true>Julie was often criticized for being “overly talkative” or “blinking too much” by her mother in the YouTube videos. Russell was seen being neglected, such as when he broke his femur and was not taken for medical care until a week later. And, Eve, the youngest of the bunch, was depicted as being irresponsible after forgetting her lunch at home.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false>Given all of the information that came out about the children and their individual situations with their mother via the YouTube channel, the case did not come as a surprise but is still extremely horrifying.

According to the police affidavit, he ran to a neighbor’s house asking for food and water. The neighbor noticed duct tape on his wrists and ankles and called the police.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=795 data-injectable=true>Russell had escaped from the home of Franke’s business partner, Jodi Hildebrandt, a self-proclaimed “mental fitness and relationship expert.” The two launched&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ConneXions Classroom</a>, which offered videos, podcasts, workbooks, and other learning tools. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">US Weekly</a>, some critics have described the “empowerment program” as a cult and have accused them of spreading hate through “homophobic, racist, and transphobic comments.”</p><p data-characters=76 data-current-count=76 data-injectable=false>That’s nothing compared to what the Franke kids endured, though.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-the-police-found-a-second-abused-child-in-a-nearby-home data-injectable=false>The police found a second abused child in a nearby home</h3><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>When the police arrived, EMS took Russell to the hospital, where he was placed on a medical hold “due to his deep lacerations from being tied up with rope and from his malnourishment.” Police were then notified that there might be children in a similar condition at a nearby home.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>Upon arrival, police found Franke’s 10-year-old daughter, Eve, highly malnourished and suffering from restraint wounds. She was also hospitalized, and both children are now with child protection services.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Authorities arrested both Franke and Hildebrandt for suspicion of child abuse, after which a judge granted the detective’s request to deny bail. Franke lawyered up immediately and hasn’t commented on the charges. Her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">husband, Kevin Franke</a>, also got a lawyer, as it appears he’s trying to gain custody of the kids. But where are the other four Franke children?</p><h3 id=h-ruby-franke-lost-custody-of-two-other-children data-injectable=false>Ruby Franke lost custody of two other children</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=202 data-injectable=false>After her arrest, CPS took custody of Franke’s other two underage children.

Ellie Mecham, Bonnie Hoellein, and Julie Deru released a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">joint statement</a>&nbsp;saying:</p><p>“For the last three years, we have kept quiet on the subject of our sister Ruby Franke for the sake of her children. Behind the public scene, we have done everything we could to try and make sure the kids were safe. We wouldn’t feel right about moving forward with regular content without addressing the most recent events. Once we do, we will not be commenting on it further. Ruby was arrested which needed to happen. Jodi was arrested which needed to happen. The kids are now safe, which is the No. 1 priority.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>Many of their fans aren’t having it, though, as the post is riddled with comments saying the family should have done more.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-viewers-have-accused-ruby-franke-of-abuse-before data-injectable=false>Viewers have accused Ruby Franke of abuse before</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true><a title=@utahvloggersyas href=#>@utahvloggersyas</a><p>🚨🚨👮‍♀️ WHOOP WHOOP <a title=8passengers href=#>#8passengers</a> <a title=utahisweird href=#>#utahisweird</a> <a title=utahvloggers href=#>#utahvloggers</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - free chad 😘🤪🙄💕" href=#>♬ original sound – free chad 😘🤪🙄💕</a></figure><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>Looking back at Franke’s controversial history, it’s pretty clear that authorities should have stepped in sooner. As her YouTube channel,&nbsp;8 Passengers,&nbsp;gained popularity, a video of her sharing that her son, Chad, slept on a beanbag for seven months went viral.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=623 data-injectable=true>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Independent</a>, Franke explained that her son slept on the beanbag after playing a prank on his sibling. Concerned viewers reported the video and started a petition in 2020 to encourage CPS to investigate the situation. However, Franke claimed Chad wanted to sleep on the beanbag, and CPS dismissed the issue.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>Franke became the center of another controversy in 2022 after a video resurfaced of her refusing to bring lunch to her then 6-year-old daughter, who’d forgotten it at home. In the video, Franke addresses a text message from Eve’s teacher. She says, “Eve is responsible for making her lunches in the morning,” which is odd to put on a young child. Then, the doting mother shares that she hopes no one gives Eve food at school, so she’s in pain all day from hunger and learns her lesson.</p><p data-characters=78 data-current-count=78 data-injectable=false>The video angered viewers, and Franke later deleted her YouTube channel.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeppMK1wcGeZrCgkal6or7EZquhnV2WtKa%2FjKidZqqll8ZustGapaSdo2K4qrDSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
