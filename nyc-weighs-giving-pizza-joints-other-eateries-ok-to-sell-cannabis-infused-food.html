New York State officials are weighing whether to allow pizzerias and other eateries to sell fresh cannabis-infused grub and packaged pot edibles, The Post has learned.
Aaron Ghitelman, a spokesman for the state Office of Cannabis Management, confirmed there have been discussions about awarding such licenses to food preparers — raising the possibility of offerings such as pesto pot pizza or pepperoni with sweet weed sauce."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Liz Krueger (D-Manhattan), a key architect in writing New York’s cannabis law, said having eateries like pizzerias using cannabis was not a hot topic when she worked on the bill — but it’s not explicitly prohibited, either.</p><p>“Of course cannabis with edibles is not a new concept,” Krueger said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">State Sen. Liz Krueger said allowing eaters to use cannabis wasn’t something that was considered when she worked on legalizing marijuana. <span class=credit>AP/Hans Pennink</span></figure><p>The <a href=#>pizza industry has been abuzz</a> about pot goods such as cannabis-infused pies, which have the possibility of generating sky-high profits.</p><p>Some pizza makers have already begun linking up with marijuana suppliers and experimenting by mixing in cannabis oils in their tomato and pesto sauces. One THC speakeasy, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stoned Pizza</a> in the East Village, advertises “gourmet cannabis pizza.”</p><p>But the idea isn’t without complications. New York’s law bars anyone under the age of 21 from purchasing cannabis, so pot pizza could not be served to children. Kids should not even be allowed on sites where cannabis-infused food is served, Krueger said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Stoned Pizza in Manhattan sells cannabis-infused food items. <span class=credit>James Keivom</span></figure><p>“So no big pie shared with kids,” she noted.</p><p>The lawmaker said the amount of cannabis in foods like pizza would have to be “labeled correctly so that one was having two slices of pizza equivalent to four doses of marijuana.”</p><p>Owners who obtain a license to sell cannabis are barred from also having a liquor license or vice versa, vastly weeding out the number of eateries that would apply.</p><p>“We’ve been advocating for on-license cannabis sales for restaurants and nightlife establishments.

One industry source questioned whether insurance companies would cover the costs of litigation if a customer sues a pizzeria claiming illness or a “bad trip” from eating weed-laced slices.</p><p>Marijuana is already being sold legally at authorized dispensaries across the Hudson in New Jersey, but a rep for the National Cannabis Industry Association said she was not aware of any state that has licensed weed-infused food licenses for pizzerias and other eateries.</p><p>“Adults must be 21 to purchase legal cannabis products from a licensed dispensary, which is held to intense regulatory and compliance standards beyond what pizzerias or other restaurants may be able to do compliantly without incurring additional operating expenses,” said spokeswoman, Bethany Moore.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Cannabis is being legally sold in New Jersey, Massachusetts and other states. <span class=credit>AP/Seth Wenig</span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j21ma2xfo8akedaeoKCgo2K0qsLIp55mqJmvx6J5yaigp6yjYry1tMSrZJ6ZpJq%2FqrHSZqakZaSkerSxy6VknJmeo66jtdJmoKeepaiypXnFqKadZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
