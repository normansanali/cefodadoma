She grew up not exactly wealthy in Missouri. She was the child of an immigrant, a story that motivates a lot of fans. She then went to college, and during that time she blossomed into a modeling career that would prove to be quite lucrative. From there on, the rest is pretty much history. And pretty good history at that...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The bigger question nowadays is how she spends her money. Since her departure from the limelight, her personal life isn't been quite as public as it used to be. Here's everything to know.</p><h2 id=this-is-how-much-money-kimora-lee-simmons-has-made>This Is How Much Money Kimora Lee Simmons Has Made</h2><p>Before figuring out how Kimora spends her money, her net worth must be taken into account.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Yahoo</a>, Kimora Lee has amassed a wild fortune of $200 million. How exactly did she get all of that money?</p><p>As mentioned earlier, Kimora got her start as a model. That alone has made her millions, considering she modeled for the prestigious Chanel company, who signed her exclusively when she was 13 years old. She actually got to work one-on-one with the iconic Karl Lagerfeld, who she claims was a mentor who led by "example".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her next shot at success was when Kimora and her ex Russell Simmons started an innovative company called <a href=#>Baby Phat</a>. The company innovated and led the diversification of the fashion industry, which is how Kimora has made the bulk of her very impressive $200 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Russell Simmons Tries To Pressure Oprah Winfrey... He Wants To Silence The Allegations</a></span></p><p>After a long time away from the company, Kimora actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased Baby Phat</a> in its entirety back in 2019. Aside from that, Kimora has invested in numerous other fashion and skin care companies. None of them have been as profitable as Baby Phat, however.</p><h2 id=what-does-kimora-lee-simmons-spend-her-money-on>What Does Kimora Lee Simmons Spend Her Money On?</h2><p>Back when Kimora Lee Simmons was a judge on 'America's Next Top Model', her lifestyle was pretty well known. However, since her appearances in the spotlight, her life has gotten to be pretty private. What is her lifestyle like now?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back when she had a relationship with Russell Simmons, the couple lived in a New Jersey mansion. After their departure from each other, Kimora moved to the West Coast and hasn't look back since.</p><p>According to Daily Mail, Kimora bought and owned a Beverly Park mansion in 2017 before selling it in early 2021. She actually lost money on the home, but it clearly hasn't affected her net worth whatsoever. Before selling it, she was renting the home out. The mansion would be a great place to live as Eddie Murphy owns one of the adjacent mansions. Perhaps Kimora is friends with Eddie, and has heard a lot of jokes during neighborhood get-togethers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Comedian Did Dwayne Johnson Buy His $27.8 Beverly Hills Mansion From?</a></span></p><p>In reality, Kimora is actually friends with the Kardashian family. According to Elle, a couple of mini sports cars were gifted to some of the children in the Kardashian-Jenner family from Kimora. While these gifts are reportedly expensive, they aren't quite as costly as the Ferrari Kimora was famously spotted filling up at a gas station in 2012.</p><h2 id=what-is-kimora-lee-simmons-up-to-nowadays>What Is Kimora Lee Simmons Up To Nowadays?</h2><p>Kimora Lee Simmons's main focus, outside of business, has been being the mother to a rather sizable group of children.</p><p>Kimora has multiple children with three separate fathers. She's had children with Russell Simmons from <a href=#>their controversial relationship</a>, two daughters named Ming and Aoki.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Kimora's divorce from Russell, she had a thing with famous actor Djimon Hounsou. Their relationship lasted for over five years, although ultimately it didn't work out. They did have a son named Kenzo, however. He took the last name of his father.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Djimon Hounsou And Kimora Lee Simmons Parent Their Kids</a></span></p><p>Kimora Lee Simmons's latest relationship has been with Tim Leissner, a financier who's worked for the elite banking company Goldman Sachs. Kimora's <a href=#>adopted a child</a> with Tim, and they have one biological child together, their son Wolf Leissner.</p><p>Altogether, that adds up to five kids in total. Some of Kimora's children have gained a reputation of being similar to their mother. Kimora's daughter Aoki actually has clapped back against a fan who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thought she shouldn't model.</a> Ultimately, despite the drama that the family's been through, all the kids seem happy and proud of their mother for what she's accomplished.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecqipKiqkWK5prGMrKCmpZ%2BjwG66xK1ksKeiqbVuv8%2BepZ2hnpx8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
