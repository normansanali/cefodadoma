According to Dr. Mayo, the remains of the man found were placed face-down on top of the woman — a common practice among this society.</p><p>While researchers are still excavating the site, they say it also contains the remains of several people who were sacrificed to accompany the lord into the “beyond.”</p><h2>The Panamanian Burial Tradition</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-477700 alt="Panama Tomb Artifacts" width=780 height=519 data-sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/panama-tomb-artifacts.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-477700 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Ministerio de Cultura de Panamá</span><span class=caption-body>Based on the number of gold artifacts buried inside the tomb, researchers believe it contained a pre-Hispanic lord.</span></p><p>Built around 700 C.E. and abandoned by 1000 C.E., the site at El Caño was a necropolis used for funerary purposes. Alongside the burials, the site contains several stone monoliths and a ceremonial area made up of wooden structures.</p><p>Dr. Mayo says Tomb No. 9 is significant because it is a case of “multiple and simultaneous burials,” so-called because they involve the burial of several people in the same tomb. While researchers don’t know exactly how many people the tomb contains, they suspect the lord was buried alongside 7 to 31 lower-status people who were “sacrificed to serve as companions” in the afterlife.</p><p>Now, archaeologists are hopeful that the site will reveal further information about the lives of social elites in pre-Hispanic Panama.</p><p>After reading about the discovery of this tomb in Panama, discover the <a href=#>history of human sacrifice</a> in pre-Columbian America.
