A former partner, Gareth Pursehouse, whose turbulent relationship with Harwick led to her filing a restraining order against him, was charged with murder and burglary.&nbsp;</p><p>But Wendy Williams wasn't going to let the sad details of the case deter her from making jokes. On <a href=#>her show</a>, she used a catchphrase from "The Price is Right" host Drew Carey to joke about his ex-fiance Harwick falling to her death, yelling: "Come on down!" Williams also summarized the case in her typically blunt way, informing her audience: "She was killed. Not by Drew." Her audience responded with shocked gasps and later viewers took to Twitter to express their shock at how callous Williams had been.&nbsp;</p><p>"For real, Wendy Williams is a sicko,"&nbsp;one <a href=#>Twitter</a> user wrote. A&nbsp;friend of Harwick <a href=#>declared</a> that it was a "CLASSLESS MOVE making a joke about a domestic violence victim," adding: "An amazing woman and champion for mental health awareness was senselessly killed and you used it as an opportunity for a one liner. HOW F***ING DARE YOU." Harwick's brother also demanded a public apology, telling <a href=#>Fox News</a>&nbsp;that the comments were unacceptable.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233. You can also find more information, resources, and support at <a href=#>their website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampjbX5zfo6uq62domKwsLnPpZytnV2ZvLi6xZqjpWWnmrulxYywoKWkmZa6tHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
