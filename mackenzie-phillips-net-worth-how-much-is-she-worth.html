She appeared in popular movies like American Graffiti where she played the role of Carol Morrison, Julie Mora Cooper Horvath on the sitcom&nbsp;One Day at a Time, and Molly Phillips on&nbsp;Disney Channel’s&nbsp;supernatural&nbsp;series&nbsp;So Weird.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Mackenzie Phillips Biography</strong></h3><p>Philips was born on November 10, 1959, in Alexandria, Virginia to American singer John Philips and his first wife, Susan Stuart Adams. She attended Highland Hall Waldorf School in Northridge, California.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h3><strong>Mackenzie Phillips Career</strong></h3><p>Phillips at the age of 12 formed a band with three of her classmates, and she was spotted by a casting agent during one of their performances. She was given an audition for a role in the 1973 film American Graffiti, which she won. She was 12 years old during the filming of&nbsp;American Graffiti<i>. </i>Mackenzie was cast as Carol Morrison, a young girl accidentally picked up by&nbsp;hot-rodding teenager John Milner.</p><p>Mackenzie went on to gain stardom in the 1970s playing teenager Julie Cooper (when the character got married, her married name was Horvath) on the long-running television show <i>One Day at a Time</i>, for which she earned $50,000&nbsp; a week. During the show’s third season in 1977, Phillips was arrested for&nbsp;disorderly conduct. Because of her drug and alcohol abuse, Phillips began arriving late and was even incoherent for rehearsals. The producers ordered her to take a six-week break to overcome her addiction but were ultimately forced to fire her in 1980.</p><p>After two near-fatal&nbsp;overdoses, Phillips entered Fair Oaks Hospital voluntarily for treatment. In 1981, the producers of&nbsp;One Day at a Time invited her back to the show.&nbsp;In 1992, Philips entered a drug rehab program for nine months.</p><p>In 1999, Phillips co-starred with&nbsp;Cara Delizia&nbsp;in the Disney Channel series&nbsp;<i>So Weird</i>, playing a fictional rock star named Molly Phillips. She sang original songs written by show producers Jon Cooksey and Ann Marie Montade. In 2002, she appeared in the Disney Channel original movie&nbsp;Double Teamed. Phillips guest-starred on episodes of&nbsp;ER,&nbsp;Without a Trace,&nbsp;7th Heaven,&nbsp;Cold Case, and&nbsp;Beverly Hills, 90210.</p><p>In 2016, Phillips began working at the Breathe Life Healing Center in&nbsp;West Hollywood, California as a drug rehab counsellor.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Phillips appeared in an episode of the rebooted <i>One Day at a Time</i> as Pam Valentine in 2017. The role was apt, given Phillips’s history: she portrayed a counsellor. She reprised the role in 2019, in two episodes of the third season.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>She also appeared as Barbara Denning in episodes of the Netflix original Orange Is the New Black in 2018.</p><h3><strong>Mackenzie Phillips’s Allegations Against Her Dad</strong></h3><p>Philips has long ago revealed that her love for drugs was caused by her dad. She appeared on&nbsp;The Oprah Winfrey Show&nbsp;for an hour-long interview. She told Winfrey that she first tried cocaine when she was 11 years old and that her father had taken drugs with her and had injected her with&nbsp;it.&nbsp;</p><p>Mackenzie also accused her father of an incest relationship. She said that at the age of 19, on the night before her first wedding in 1979, “I woke up that night from a blackout to find myself having “private relationships” with my own father,” and that when she confronted her father months later, asking why he had raped her, her father simply replied, “Raped you? Don’t you mean we made love?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>John died in 2001 at the age of 65 after suffering from heart failure. Mackenzie was at his bedside and released a statement.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h3><strong>Mackenzie Phillips Net Worth: How Much Is She Worth?</strong></h3><p>Phlips’s net worth is estimated at around $1 million.
