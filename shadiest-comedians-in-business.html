His stand-up shows had sold out Madison Square Garden eight times and the TV series that he created and starred in, "Louie," was critically acclaimed and Emmy-nominated. C.K. was also responsible for creating several other hit series&nbsp;including "Horace and Pete," "Baskets," and "Better Things." But after five women accused him of sexual misconduct, public opinion swiftly changed against him.</p><p>Per <a href=#>The New York Times</a>, the women in question each detailed disturbing allegations concerning C.K.'s alleged penchant for exposing himself to women and masturbating in front of them. Unproven rumors had swirled within the industry about his behavior toward women in the years prior. In a statement published by <a href=#>CNN</a>, the comedian admitted that the women's stories were true. However, the statement did not include an actual apology.</p><p>When C.K. returned to the stage in 2018, he seemed to have a bit of a chip on his shoulder, deciding to aim his ire at *checks notes* survivors of a school shooting.&nbsp;"You're not interesting because you went to a high school where kids got shot," <a href=#>he quipped</a> about the Parkland school shooting, per <a href=#>Slate</a>. "... You pushed some fat kid in the way and now I've got to listen to you talking?" Later, during a performance at a San Jose comedy club, C.K. said (via Slate), "If you ever need people to forget that you jerked off, what you do is you make a joke about kids that got shot."&nbsp;</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available. Visit the <a href=#>Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network website</a> or contact RAINN's National Helpline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).</p><p>If you have been impacted by incidents of mass violence, or are experiencing emotional distress related to incidents of mass violence, you can call or text <a href=#>Disaster Distress Helpline</a> at 1-800-985-5990 for support.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampmbIV6hI6sn5qcmZrAtXnCqKSenJmWu7R5yKdkm62jnrumv9Jo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
