While Fisher sometimes <a href=#>talked about her husband's comedy</a>, one of the <a href=#>most important facts about the couple</a> is that they didn't talk about each other. But even though Fisher and Baron Cohen were always mysterious, they looked happy in photos and there was never any sign that anything was wrong. That's why when Page Six reported in early April 2024 that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple <strong>decided to end their marriage</strong></a><strong>after 14 years</strong>, it was definitely shocking.</p><p>In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>what we know about Sacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher's marriage before their divorce announcement</strong>.

She said:</p><p>"I don't know if that's the secret. But having a shared ability to find humor in the sharpness of life is always going to bring connection.
