John Turturro is also set to play Carmine Falcone.</p><p>The Clown Prince of Prime received its one standalone 2019 film, Joker, which starred Joaquin Phoenix. A young Bruce Wayne (along with Alfred Pennyworth and Thomas and Martha Wayne) appeared in the film.</p><p>This&nbsp;led many to wonder if Phoenix's Joker would appear in The Batman, which stars Robert Pattinson as the Caped Crusader. However, the Twilight star has already <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed that Phoenix will not be in the film</a>.</p><p>But if Reeves decided to add Batman's archenemy to the film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Smith</a> has a big name in mind for the role.</p><p>On the Fatman Beyond podcast (h/t <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spencer Perry of ComicBook.com</a>), Smith mentioned&nbsp;a rumor about&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnny Depp</a>&nbsp;portraying Joker in The Batman, which is slated for a 2021 release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And Smith explained why he thinks the Pirates of the Caribbean star would make the perfect Joker for The Batman.</p><p>"Now this is the first anyone's even heard about there being a possibility of a Joker in The Batman movie, on the heels of the Joker which one Oscars and made over a billion dollars and Joaquin just locked that part town, but it looks like now this is an Oscar bait part.</p><p>Who the (expletive) wouldn't want to play The Joker? Heath Ledger won an Oscar, Joaquin Phoenix won an Oscar, and of all the actors out there that could possibly take a role of the dice on The Joker, Johnny Depp (is) actually kinda (expletive) perfect.</p><p>You gotta admit he'd be fun man, like of all the parts he's played he's kind of perfect for a take on The Joker."</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Affleck On Why He Lost "Passion" To Continue Playing Batman</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depp&nbsp;is renowned worldwide praise for his ability to portray completely different characters, be it the adventurous and noble Captain Jack Sparrow or the humorous and colourful Willy Wonka (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). There's little doubting that he'd be a terrific Joker, but this is merely speculation right now.</p><p>Jack Nicholson became the first person to portray the Clown Prince of Crime in a live theatrical&nbsp;film. He starred alongside Michael Keaton in Batman (1989). The late Heath Ledger portrayed Joker in The Dark Knight (2008), winning the Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor.</p><p>With Phoenix already starring in a Joker film, and with the door to a sequel open, it's hard to imagine Reeves already throwing in his own version of the Joker for his first Batman film. But you never know.</p><p><strong><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Marvel Has Discussed Resurrecting Thanos For Phase Four Of The MCU</a></span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8qeraKmXai6qsDHZquhoZ6gwG62zqGlp7FdmbKxvIywpq6klGKvpnnGq5yarF2fvKyx0Wg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
