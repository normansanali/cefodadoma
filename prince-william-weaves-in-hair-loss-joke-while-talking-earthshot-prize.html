(In addition to George, now 10, William and <a href=#><strong>Princess Kate</strong></a> are also the proud parents of daughter <a href=#>Princess Charlotte</a>, 8, and son <a href=#>Prince Louis</a>, 5.)</p><p>“He’s got way more [hair] than me, thank God,” William quipped at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Prince-William-Jokes-About-Hair-Loss.jpg><p>One year later, Kate, 41, even <a href=#>ribbed her husband about his thinning hair</a> during a visit to Sydney Royal Easter Show in Australia. After the couple were shown a tuft of alpaca wool, “the Princess said he should put it on his head,” exhibitor <strong>Lyn Crejan</strong> recalled at the time. “She said, ‘You need it more than me,’ and pointed to his head and he laughed.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a> — who has been <a href=#>at odds with his brother</a> since he and <a href=#><strong>Meghan Markle</strong></a> stepped down from their duties as senior royals in 2020 — even remarked on William’s hair in his tell-all memoir, Spare. Unlike William and Kate’s comments, however, Harry’s were not made in jest.</p><p>Recalling a charged moment where he “looked at [William], maybe for the first time since we were boys,” <a href=#>Harry took notice of his older brother’s “alarming baldness,”</a> he wrote in the book, which was released in January. He also observed that his resemblance to their late mother, <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>, was fading.</p><p>“In some ways he was my mirror, in some ways he was my opposite,” Harry, 38, penned. “My beloved brother, my archnemesis, how had that happened?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As William continues to contend with his baldness — and tumultuous relationship with Harry — he is “very much looking forward to his trip across the pond” in September for the Earthshot Prize Summit and “several other engagements and meetings while he is in New York for just over two days,” a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly </a>last month.</p><p>As he explained on the Sorted Food YouTube Channel, William founded Earthshot as an “environmental prize [to those] tackling the world’s greatest environmental problems.” Explaining that the concept was “born out of” late President John F. Kennedy’s “Moonshoot” initiative to send man to the moon, the Earthshot Prize is “about saving the planet, not taking us to the moon.”</p><p>“There’s plenty of people out there who want us to move to the next planet already,” William quipped. “And I’m like, ‘Hang on, let’s not give up on this planet yet.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6W%2FqrrCnmSwoZyhtqK5jLCcmq6VqHqquoyhmKKqXaG8tL%2BMo6aknV2staq4xGarmqSbnruoecSaqa2go528tXnPq6CznV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
