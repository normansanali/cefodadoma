The USS Lexington, nicknamed “Lady Lex,” was one of the first U.S aircraft carriers ever built. The carrier was sunk during World War II‘s Battle of the Coral Sea in an intense assault against three Japanese aircraft carriers in May of 1942 and had remained missing ever since."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The carrier was sunk during <a href=#>World War II</a>‘s Battle of the Coral Sea in an intense assault against three Japanese aircraft carriers in May of 1942 and had remained missing ever since. That is, until now.</p><p>On March 4, 2018, a team of deep-sea explorers led by Microsoft’s co-founder, Paul Allen, <a href=# rel=noopener>uncovered</a> vessel that has been missing for 76 years. It was found off the eastern coast of Australia at the bottom of the Coral Sea, nearly two miles below the surface of the water. The crew used a R/V Petrel, a 250-foot research vessel, to locate the wreckage.</p><p>Allen’s company, Vulcan Inc., funded the expedition. In a statement on behalf of the company, Director of Subsea Operations Robert Kraft said, “Lexington was on our priority list because she was one of the capital ships that was lost during World War II.”</p><p>Footage of the discovered wreckage was recorded and is fascinating to look at. The footage also captured some remarkable finds including the remains of anti-aircraft guns and airplanes. A striking detail is a preserved painting of the cartoon Felix the Cat on the side of one of the planes.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-160220 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/uss-lexington-wreckage.png alt="USS Lexington Wreckage" width=900 height=267 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-160220 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Paul Allen</span><span class=caption-body>Underwater shot of Lady Lex plane wreckage.</span></p><p>The Battle of the Coral Sea was notable for several reasons. Firstly, it took place just one month before the Battle of Midway, which was considered a turning point in the Pacific war after the U.S. Navy took Japanese forces by surprise.</p><p>The battle also instituted a new form of naval warfare in which carrier-based airplanes took center stage. It was the first in history where opposing ships never came within sight of one another.</p><p>When “Lady Lex” sunk, 216 of its crew members were lost as well. Naval Admiral Harry B. Harris Jr. is the current head of the U.S Pacific Command and has a special connecting to the USS Lexington.</p><p>“As the son of a survivor of the USS Lexington, I offer my congratulations to Paul Allen and the expedition crew,” Harris said, adding, “We honor the valor and sacrifice of the ‘Lady Lex’s’ sailors — all those Americans who fought in World War II — by continuing to secure the freedoms they won for all of us.”</p><p>If you found the discovery of the USS Lexington interesting, you may enjoy reading about <a href=#>the 5 Japanese warships that were discovered from the Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>.
