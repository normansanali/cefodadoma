"My brother really was smitten with her right from the very beginning when he first met her at dinner," John's younger brother <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Ted Kennedy</a> claimed in Sarah Bradford's 2000 book, America's Queen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jackie reportedly had a more realistic view of the situation. "Jackie later says she determined of their relationship, 'Such heartbreak would be worth the pain,' " wrote <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>James Patterson</a> in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>The House of Kennedy</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They would still go on to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wed in 1953</a>, with four children in total being born to the couple, though only two — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Caroline Kennedy</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>John F. Kennedy Jr.</a> — ever left the hospital. Tragically, in 1956 Jackie gave birth to their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>stillborn daughter</a>, Arabella, and the couple's fourth child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5>died just 39 hours</a> after birth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to their fertility struggles, the Kennedy's relationship was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>marred by infidelity</a>. By most accounts, Jackie was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>well aware of her husband's alleged indiscretions</a>. "It was a marriage of its time," a close family friend told PEOPLE. "It was kinetic between them. She wasn't trying to change him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Others, however, say that John's assumed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cheating was a source of contention</a> for the couple. "There were many senators and people who worked for the president who were really well aware of the conversations that Jackie had with JFK, in which she made it really clear that she knew what was going on," Jackie, Janet and Lee author J. Randy Taraborrelli told PEOPLE. "She wasn't naive to it. They did have many conversations about it, and she did tell him that she was sick of it and she didn't like it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As one of the couple's friends told PEOPLE, "At the end of the day, Jack came back to Jackie — and that was it. They loved each other."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Proof of Jackie's love and care for John, in the form of hand-written letters and meal plans, went <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>up for auction</a> in July 2023. The letters included intricate instructions for her and the then-Senator's meals, including a note that instructs that John "can eat nothing fried."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's a look back at John F.

The hotel's blog also claims that the politician got down on one knee to present Jackie with her now-famous 2.88-carat emerald-cut diamond <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>engagement ring</a> from Van Cleef & Arpels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another account, however, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>claims that the event took place</a> at Martin's Tavern in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., with former ambassador Marion Smoak claiming to be an eyewitness. According to Smoak, it was a quiet event. "After the senator proposed, and she accepted, the news ran through the restaurant," he recalls.

The affair was one to remember, with roughly 600 diplomats, senators and social figures in attendance for the ceremony and 900 at the reception. Jackie's stepfather, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Hugh D.

"If ever I can find some healing and some comfort — it has to be with somebody who is not part of all my world of past and pain," she wrote.

Randy Taraborrelli <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>told PEOPLE</a>. "She realized she would not be able to live with herself if something happened to Jackie and the kids because she had not allowed Onassis to be their protector.

"I think from Onassis' point of view, it was an acquisition," he said. "Not that he didn't love Jackie but I don't think he was in love with her, nor she with him. Jackie said it best — that he rescued her from the darkest time in her life. He protected her and her children."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-191 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jackie's former live-in assistant, Kathy McKeon, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>expressed similar sentiments</a> in her memoir Jackie's Girl.
