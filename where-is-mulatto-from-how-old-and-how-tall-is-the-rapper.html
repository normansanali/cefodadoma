Her birth name is Alyssa Michelle Stephens. She was born to African American father, Shayne Pitts, and a white caucasian mother named Misti Stephens Pitts. The fact that her parents come from separate ethnic backgrounds makes Mulatto a child of mixed ethnic origins.</p><p>The talented rapper who is originally from Atlanta, Georgia, but was born in Ohio moved back to her hometown with her family when she was just two years old and was raised alongside two other siblings, sisters, Brooklyn and Kay, in Clayton County, Georgia. Clayton County turned out to be the launching pad for the talented rapper’s career. Her personality, strength of character, and skill were all developed at Clayton County.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Mulatto Now?</strong></h3><p>The beautiful and quite talented rapper just turned 25 years old, having been born on December 22, 1998. As previously mentioned, Mulatto has two sisters who appear to be following in her footsteps as the three sisters, and their father was seen rapping on Instagram.</p><p>However, it appears that the only family member currently active in Latto’s career is her father, who currently <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>serves as her manager</a>.&nbsp;Not much is known about Mulatto’s white mother, as she doesn’t often make public appearances like the rest of her family members. It is also quite challenging to figure out what she does for a living.</p><h3><strong>What Is Mulatto’s Height </strong><strong>Compared To Saweetie And Kash Doll?</strong></h3><p>Big Latto has a diminutive height, which is a prevailing attribute among other female rappers. She is 5 feet 6 inches tall. However, she is at least 2 inches taller than a fellow rapper, Kash Doll, who stands at 5 feet 4 inches, but just barely an inch shorter than another of her contemporaries, Saweetie, who stands at 5 feet 7 inches.</p><p><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/03/BeFunky-collage-25.jpg alt=Mulatto width=696 height=464 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Latto has a bodyweight of 65kg (143lbs), which she keeps in good shape with regular exercises and proper eating habits. Although her exact body measurements are not known at the moment, her hourglass figure makes her look quite desirable and attractive. Every aspect of her body looks natural, and there is no actual record or indication that she has done any work on her body.</p><h2><strong>Mulatto Was Bullied In High School&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>It is not exactly clear where Big Latto had her preschool and middle school formal education. Still, one statistic about the talented rapper that rings true is that her formal education took place at Clayton County, where her family moved when she was two years old.</p><p>After the early years of her formal education, she was enrolled in Lovejoy High School, Clayton, Georgia. Latto started exhibiting signs of the star she would turn out to be while she was in high school, but it wasn’t all smooth sailing for her as she was constantly picked on because of her ethnic heritage.</p><p>She was dubbed “Mulatto”, which means someone born to a black father and a white mother or vice versa because of her much lighter skin. This incident was not even nearly sufficient to bring down the talented rapper. Instead, it was fuel for her to push on and start writing her songs from the age of ten.</p><p>Also, the taunts and name-calling became a source of inspiration which toughened her up. When the time came for her to choose a stage name, she picked, you guessed it, “Miss Mulatto.”</p><h2><strong>She </strong><strong>Dropped Out To&nbsp;</strong><strong>Begin Her Rap Career When She Was 18 Years Old</strong></h2><p>By the time she was 18 years old, Miss Mulatto had had enough of regular schooling experience. She abandoned school in favor of pursuing her dreams of becoming an actor. However, she needed the perfect platform to launch her career, which was presented to her in 2016.</p><p>Queen Latifah and Jermaine Dupri came together to host a Lifetime reality rap show and titled it “The Rap Game.” The show was an eight-week, intensive program that brought talented and aspiring rappers together to compete for the grand prize of a recording contract.</p><p>At the end of the competition, Miss Mulatto emerged as the competition’s winner, and boom, her name spread like wildfire. Firstly, she was offered a recording deal by the show’s producer, Jermaine Dupri’s, recording company. Still, she ended up saying no because she felt it wasn’t financially lucrative enough and went solo instead.</p><p>She dropped her first single, No More Talking, in 2016 before she teamed up with fellow The Rap Game contestant Lil Niqo to drop yet another single, Tough From The Internet. Over the following three years, the talented rapper’s star grew, and she quickly became a household name. She collaborated with many well-known artists, including Lil Key, Brazzy, and ex-boyfriend, Bandit Gang Marco.</p><p>The very big one came for Miss Mulatto in 2019 when she dropped the single, Bitch from da souf.&nbsp;The same year she signed a very lucrative contract with RCA Records. The following year her 2019 single entered the Billboard 100. Financially, Big Latto is doing quite well for herself as she has an estimated net worth of $700,000 as of December 2021. She also changed her name to Latto in 2021, after her former stage name Mulatto was deemed racially offensive by the public.</p><h3><strong>Mulatto’s Discography</strong></h3><p>The talented rapper has achieved fame and success with an eye-catching number of studio and single releases to her name.
