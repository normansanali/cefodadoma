When you pair that with the fact that Coloma declined to film his final scenes, he seems to be getting an actual exit story.
Coloma refusing to film wouldn’t be an issue if a permanent recast was already lined up and waiting in the wings."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The point is the show’s said to have written Coloma out – and that presumably means they’ve written Nikolas out, too.</p><p>That said, SOD got an interesting comment from the ABC soap that confirmed Coloma’s departure and offered a timeframe for when he’ll finish airing.</p><p>According to the show, “Marcus Coloma will no longer be playing the role of Nikolas Cassadine. His last airdate will be at the end of January.”</p><p>The word choice leaves the door open for someone else to be playing the role of Nikolas – perhaps beyond a temporary replacement.</p><p>Could the plan be to rest the character for a while and bring in a permanent recast somewhere down the road?</p><p>Adam Huss is perfectly fine as a temp Nikolas, but he doesn’t seem like a good fit long-term.</p><p>Some GH fans are holding out hope that Tyler Christopher might make a comeback as Nik, but the show could choose to go with someone new.</p><p>Regardless, the goal seems to be taking Nikolas off canvas for a while. Even if Nikolas returns with a new face eventually, all signs point to an official exit for now.</p><p>Nikolas could land in prison over this whole Esme Prince (Avery Pohl) hostage situation – or he could go on the run to avoid it!</p><p>Of course, we can’t rule out the idea of “The Hook” claiming Nikolas as a victim if GH gets gutsy.</p><p>Ava Jerome (Maura West), Ryan Chamberlain (Jon Lindstrom) and Heather Webber (Alley Mills) are all out to get Nikolas as well, so danger could come at him from multiple angles.</p><p>It seems like a mistake to kill Nikolas off again after going to the trouble of bringing him back from the dead.</p><p>Nevertheless, it’s an option to consider since things remain up in the air regarding Nikolas’ upcoming departure.</p><p>General Hospital spoilers say Nikolas will continue to face bad news as his life unravels, so stay tuned for updates on the mess!</p><p>CDL’s the place to be for the hottest <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital spoilers, updates and news, so drop by regularly.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWtnl5q7pr7ApWShp6OltrWty2aqqaeZobKzv4ynoKSnnJbAbrLUrayrnV2nsrexwKWcnWWnnrmtecahZKmdoqKur7HNraOyZaKasKK%2F02amq2WbmrKxecKhmKuZk6mys3nOn51mm5Gjw6K%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
