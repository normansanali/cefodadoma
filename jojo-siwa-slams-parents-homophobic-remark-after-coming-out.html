Right now, I’m super, duper happy and I want to share everything with the world but I also want to keep things in my life private until they are ready to be public.”</p><p>While some of the feedback surrounding her sexuality has been negative, Siwa said that she has received “the most endless amount of love and support” since sharing her truth. <a href=#><strong>Abby Lee Miller</strong></a>, her former dance coach, was among those <a href=#>who shared an encouraging message</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I always knew the world would be a more colorful, positive, sparkly place with a kind, loving, dazzling triple threat like you in it — a shining example for the kids out there to live their BEST lives each and every day,” the Abby Lee Dance Company owner, 55, wrote <a href=#>via Instagram</a> on Sunday, January 24, alongside several throwback pics of the duo. “You put your heart on the platter! (If you know you know) Love you kiddo!!! Keep making me proud 🌈 #aldcalways.”</p><p>The TikTok star also received love from <a href=#><strong>Kerry Washington</strong></a>, who praised the teen for her “commitment to being authentically unapologetically and beautifully YOU.”<a href=#><strong> Kim Kardashian</strong></a> shared <a href=#>her “love”</a> for Siwa, while <a href=#><strong>Jamie Lynn Spears</strong></a> commented that she is “sooooo happy to see you happy.” Her former Dance Moms costar <a href=#><strong>Kendall Vertes</strong></a> additionally referred to Siwa as “my girl.”</p><p>The social media personality hinted at her sexual orientation before going into detail on Instagram Live. She <a href=#>tweeted out a photo</a> on January 22 of a T-shirt that she received from her cousin, which read: <a href=#>“Best. Gay. Cousin Ever.”</a> Before that, Siwa <a href=#>shared a video</a> of herself mouthing the words to <a href=#><strong>Lady Gaga</strong></a>’s hit “Born This Way,” which has become known as an LGBTQ anthem.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5qkerS11ppkrKSRosBuvMCrnKeso2K1sLnOqZ%2BompmYerOxzJqppGWRm8Gmvoycpqahnpx6sMHTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
