According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Bunnell’s net worth is as high as $12 million, an amount earned through his successful career as a musician.</p><h3>Dewey Bunnell Net Worth $12 Million</h3><p>Dewey is the son of an American father who was with the US Air Force based at RAF South Ruislip, and his wife who was English. From the inception of The Beatles, Dewey became infatuated with their sound and also listened to the Beach Boys. As he got older, his interest and ambitions increased, and while in London Central High School, he met and befriended <a href=#>Gerry Beckley</a> and Dan Peek – they started the band America in 1969, at their second attempt. Peek left the group in 1977 to start a career on his own, and since then Dewey and <a href=#>Beckley</a> remained the two original members. Their first self-title album came out in 1971, and topped the US Billboard chart, and achieved platinum status in both Canada and the US. They continued successfully throughout the ‘70s, releasing the albums “Homecoming” (1972) – which also achieved platinum status in USA, increasing Dewey’s net worth to a large degree – then “Holiday” (1974), “Hearts” (1975), and “Hideaway” (1976). After the end of the ‘70s, the band’s popularity began to fade, and although they released a number of new albums, none of them reached the popularity of their releases from the ‘70s. However, they had some success with compilation albums, such as “The Definitive America” (2001), which achieved platinum status in Australia. Their most recent release is the album “Lost & Found” (2015), which comprises songs recorded but unreleased between 2002 and 2010.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Dewey has been married to Penny since 2002. Previously, he was married to Vivien for 27 years, before they divorced in 1999; the two have a daughter and a son together.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=8.8784067085954><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Dewey Bunnell</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 19, 1952</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Harrogate, Yorkshire, England, UK</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Soundtrack, Music Department, Actor</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>London Central Elementary High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Penny Bunnell (m. 2002), Vivien Bunnell (m. ?–1999)</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0120520/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.24615384615385><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dewey-bunnell-mn0000207885</a></td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>America (Since 1970)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Movies</td><td>America: Live in Chicago, America: Live, Burn-out</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=10><td>1</td><td>I wanted to capture the imagery of the desert, because I was sitting in this room in England, and it was rainy.
