Be prepared for Season 6 to bring a thrilling mix of romance and drama, unlike anything you’ve ever seen.</p><p>Who is she? What is her job? Is she on Instagram? Has she shared her last name with the public? Here is what we know by far about Violet and her partner Riley from 90 Day Fiance.</p><h3><strong>Are 90 Day Fiance Violet And Riley Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Violet, a Vietnamese, meets her boyfriend <a href=#>D. Jus Riley</a> online. He enjoys indulging in the world of premium cigars and finds comfort in mesmerizing jazz music. He is a man of many interests. Riley’s hope is revived by the presence of Violet, a Vietnamese woman he met in the virtual world, despite the profound scars engraved into his heart. Their relationship has developed over the past two years as a result of their sincere online discussions, which have shown signs of a love that could be able to mend his broken heart.</p><p>Riley now embarks on a historic trip to Vietnam in an effort to firmly establish their relationship. He is eager to finally see his mysterious paramour in person. The road to love hasn’t been without its share of obstacles, though. Riley has begun to doubt the sincerity of his bond with Violet due to the lingering effects of earlier lies.</p><p>Riley mulls hiring a private investigator because he yearns for assurance and trust and believes he has been the victim of catfishing.

An undertone of uncertainty and dread, particularly with regard to the sincerity of their connection, has developed since trust has remained elusive. A crucial turning point is hinted at in the show’s teaser when they ultimately meet in person in Vietnam.</p><p>The welcoming atmosphere provided by Violet, complete with flowers, creates the possibility of a life-changing encounter. Riley makes a joking remark about Violet’s attractiveness during their first exchange, yet even then their conversation seems informal and lighthearted.</p><p>Furthermore, there are questions regarding whether the couple moved forward in their relationship in real life given the lack of any social media presence that would confirm it. It seems unlikely that the pair is still together given the difficulties and dynamics seen both on and off the show. The future of their relationship is uncertain because of the rocky road they have traveled together and the persistent trust problems.</p><p>Based on the first look, some fans were reminded of 90 Day alum Rose after watching Violet who became popular for her relationship with Big Ed.
