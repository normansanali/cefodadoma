I’m trying to be a better person.”</p><p>Later in the track, the “Bad and Boujee” rapper mentions his <a href=#>7-month-old daughter with Cardi, Kulture Kiari Cephus</a>, and seemingly alludes to a warning his wife, 26, <a href=#>described at a December 2017 concert</a>. “I let a n—a know, though: You do that s—t again, you gon’ lose your wife,” Cardi said at the time.</p><p>“You told me, ‘Don’t use me,’ (Don’t use you),” Offset sings in the chorus. “KK, all beauty (KK) / When I’m lookin’ down at her, it’s you and me / She told me, ‘Don’t lose me. Don’t lose me.’”</p><p>In the second verse, Offset recommits to his on-again, off-again love: “Number one, it’s a loyalty code (Number one) / Temptation, had the devil in my soul (Temptation) / I wanna be with you when we old (When we old) / We didn’t do this, we didn’t know how s—t goes (We didn’t know).”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And the Georgia native lists all the things he loves about her: “You bad, you a cutie / I love your attitude, moody / I love when you call a n—a stupid / I love that you’re ratchet, not boujee / I love your ass-shots, it’s a movie / When you leave by my side, I get woozy.”</p><p>Offset publicly proposed to Cardi B in October 2017, though the couple had actually <a href=#>married in private one month earlier</a>. The Grammy winner, who <a href=#>brought her husband on stage with her</a> as she accepted the award for Best Rap Album at the February event, announced her and Offset’s breakup in December 2018 but <a href=#>reunited with him for a Puerto Rican vacation</a> later that month.</p><p>The pair also attended a Father of 4 listening party together in Atlanta on Thursday, February 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKafnqOawW6tz6ijqJ%2BZr7K0edOoZJyZopm2bq6MoqVmnJ%2BjwW64zqycZqWVYsCwusZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
