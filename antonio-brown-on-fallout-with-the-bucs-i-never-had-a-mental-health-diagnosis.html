Brown was cut from the team earlier this month after cameras captured him taking off his shoulder pads, jersey and undershirt and leaving the field in the middle of a game.
In his first network news interview since the episode, Brown told “CBS Mornings” co-host Nate Burleson that the on-field incident was triggered by an ankle injury that he says was not taken seriously by his coach."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I don’t take pills. I just got a high IQ.”&nbsp;</p><p>He told Burleson he has tried therapy, but has been unable to find a connection with a therapist.&nbsp;</p><p>“I tried it through the NFL, but I don’t really got time to consult with random people I don’t know about my mental space or how I look at things,” Brown said. “Most of the people from different forms of the world. Like, I’m from the pit. Most of the people we talk to, they from the palace. So how your lenses look at life is not how mines is.”&nbsp;</p><p>Brown tells CBS News he’s considering legal action against the team, stemming from the on-field incident. &nbsp;</p><p>More of Nate Burleson’s interview with Antonio Brown will air on “CBS Mornings” on Thursday, January 27.&nbsp;</p><a href=# class="component__view-more component__view-more--sm" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http>More</a><h4 class=item__hed>Download our Free App</h4><p class=item__dek>For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on cbsnews.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tomZ6pvK%2B1zmaZq6eno3qwuoyfmKWkn6rBbsPIrZ9mrJiaeqPBwqxkomWemsOmvoyhmJ1lkWK6prrTmqNmoJWWubW0jJ2gmp%2BepMCqv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
