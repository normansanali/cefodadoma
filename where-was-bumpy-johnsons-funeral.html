But he was much more than just the “Harlem Godfather.” Johnson was revered in his circles, and known for being generous with his community — while simultaneously brutalizing his enemies.

His strange nickname has multiple alleged origins. <a href=#>Family members claimed</a> that the name came from his tenacity. Since he, “took the bumps of life,” so well, his family christened him “Bumpy.” <a href=#>Other claims say</a> he had a slight skull deformation as a child, and the nickname stuck from a young age.</p><p data-characters=475 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>After moving to live with his sister in New York, Johnson dropped out of high school to make money by pool hustling and offering protection to high-profile bankers in Harlem. It didn’t take long for him to become one of the most sought-after bodyguards in the area. He quickly jumped to more formidable criminal endeavors, like armed robbery, extortion, and pimping. Through the years he was regularly caught by law enforcement, and spent much of his twenties incarcerated.</p><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>While in prison, he whittled away the hours studying history, and even became an accomplished chess player. After his release from prison in 1932, Johnson met and partnered with Stephanie St. Clair, the “Numbers Queen of Harlem.” Together, the two pushed back against the Mafia and a German-Jewish mobster, Dutch Shultz. 12 years later, Johnson’s crew of 9 had managed to kidnap or kill 40 rival gang members with guerilla warfare-like tactics.</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>In the end, Lucky Luciano, head of the Italian Mafia, removed Schultz from the picture, and the remaining gangs struck an accord. The Mafia would leave the Harlem Bookmakers alone in exchange for a cut of their profits. When St. Claire retired, she left the empire to Johnson, who assumed leadership as the Godfather of Harlem.</p><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=761 data-injectable=true>Bumpy Johnson ruled with a stern hand, and nothing happened in the NYC borough without his go-ahead. While he was unforgiving with his rivals – he once stabbed his nemesis 36 times in one encounter – he was known for being generous within his community. He encouraged the younger generations to study rather than pursue crime, supplied his neighborhood with turkey dinners on Thanksgiving, and wielded his money for change. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>His reign didn’t last long, and he was sentenced to 15 years in Alcatraz for selling narcotics in 1951. During his absence, Harlem was flooded with narcotics, and by the time Johnson was released in 1963, his old neighborhood was in dire straits. He worked with Civil Rights leader <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Malcolm X </a>to bring attention to the issue, and briefly offered protection to X, who waived it when he realized how the association reflected on his cause. Malcolm X was assassinated shortly after Johnson pulled his protection.</p><h2 id=h-how-did-bumpy-johnson-die data-injectable=false>How did Bumpy Johnson die?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>While out dining with friends during the wee hours of the morning in July 1968, Johnson was<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> stricken with a heart attack</a>.

The Church is an important institution in the Harlem African-American community, both spiritually and politically, and has hosted a number of political rallies and community events since 1933.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>Thousands of people attended the service. Police in civilian clothes were stationed on the surrounding rooftops, and Johnson’s wife speculated that they must have feared, “Bumpy was going to get up from the casket and start raising hell,” since they brought shotguns to the funeral.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where is Bumpy Johnson buried?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bumpy-johnson-1.jpg><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>If you’d like to pay your respects to the man himself, Johnson’s grave can be found in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Woodlawn Cemetery</a> in The Bronx.
