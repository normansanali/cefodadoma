The series was given a broad 2022 release date and Kevin Feige confirmed the series would come with ten 30-minute episodes.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>Over time news broke that Tatiana Maslany will play Jennifer Walters, Mark Ruffalo will reprise his role as Walter’s cousin Bruce Banner aka the Hulk, and a full-length trailer was finally released after months of waiting.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Because She-Hulk began filming in April 2021 and supposedly wrapped up in August 2021, all signs pointed to the show premiering around the summer of 2022, but Ms. Marvel took that spot, premiering June 8 and giving Jennifer Walter the cosmic boot. Now that Ms. Marvel has premiered and we’re well into 2022, we finally know when Jennifer Walters will get her time in court.</p><h3 id=h-what-is-the-she-hulk-attorney-at-law-release-date-on-disney-plus data-injectable=false>What is the She-Hulk: Attorney at Law release date on Disney Plus?</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>Out of all the Marvel shows on Disney Plus, She-Hulk: Attorney at Law has been the most delayed, and for obvious reasons. Production had to deal with delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the real delay came from She-Hulk’s CGI.</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>In the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scott Hasn’t Seen</a> podcast, Maslany confirmed that her character is “All CG… I’m in mo-cap the whole time. I’m on platforms with mo-cap where I have a little head on the top of my head.”</p><p data-characters=530 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>Not only did Marvel have to contend with She-Hulk’s head-to-toe CGI, but Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk too. The strain it took to achieve both feats was felt when the full-length trailer was released to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">less than satisfactory praise</a> from fans. The 1080p version of the trailer uploaded by Marvel Entertainment to YouTube was met with an outcry of complaints from fans saying that Walters looked animated. The studio re-uploaded the trailer to the Disney Plus streaming platform with apparent fixes, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">much to the relief of fans</a>.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>The dip in excitement has picked up since then, and She-Hulk: Attorney at Law is moving full speed ahead, with some cushion room between now and then for the visual effects department to put the finishing touches on the character’s CGI.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=false>She-Hulk: Attorney at Law was initially scheduled to release on Wednesday Aug. 17. in a curious move from Marvel Studios and Disney Plus, however, a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new promo</a> on Twitter revealed that the show is officially moving to Thursday August 18, 2022, with weekly Thursday episode releases going forth. Case closed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXam1pnnSoZxmoKWhuG6%2BxKWcmquVYrGiwMRmpqdllJ7Ar7HYZqelraNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
