About The Brit singer might be best known for hit songs like “Smile” and “LDN,” but it’s her personal life that gets most people talking.
Born in London in 1985, the young Allen was a troublemaker who saw singing as a way to do something good with her life. Unfortunately, her bad behavior and dependency on drugs and alcohol hindered her from initially scoring a record deal, but thanks to social networking site MySpace, Allen’s big break came after she set up a music page to get the word out."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Unfortunately, her bad behavior and dependency on drugs and alcohol hindered her from initially scoring a record deal, but thanks to social networking site MySpace, Allen’s big break came after she set up a music page to get the word out. Allen’s 2006 debut Alright, Still was followed up with the digitally-released It’s Not Me, It’s You, which debuted in early 2009.</p><p>After a brief hiatus, Allen released her third album, Sheezus, in May 2014 and followed that up with No Shame in June 2018. She published an unflinchingly honest memoir, My Thoughts Exactly, in September 2018. Allen later turned to acting, appearing in 2019’s How to Build a Girl and starring in the West End play 2:22 A Ghost Story from 2021 until 2022. She earned an Olivier Award nomination for Best Actress for her stage performance.</p><p>Allen formerly dated Chemical Brothers member <strong>Ed Simons</strong>, but the two broke up shortly after she had a miscarriage in early 2008.</p><p>The singer wed <strong>Sam Cooper</strong> on June 11, 2011. She gave birth to their first child, Ethel Mary, that same year and welcomed daughter Marnie Rose in 2013. Allen was diagnosed with postpartum depression following the birth of her second child, and in 2017, she shared that she had been diagnosed with PTSD and bipolar disorder. She and Cooper separated in 2016 and their divorce was finalized in June 2018.</p><p>Allen was first linked to <a href=#><strong>David Harbour</strong></a> in August 2019. She confirmed their engagement in May 2020 before the couple tied the knot in Las Vegas that September.</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxnnJ65unnApaOepl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
