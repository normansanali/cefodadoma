While <a href=#>some viewers that hated the show</a> won't be sad to see it go, lots of loyal viewers watched and enjoyed NCIS: Los Angeles throughout its 14-season run.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When a show stays on the air as long as NCIS: Los Angeles did, there tend to be a lot of reasons why it enjoyed lasting success. When it comes to NCIS: Los Angeles, one of the reasons it lasted so long is it featured <a href=#>a talented and fascinating cast</a>.</p><p>While some NCIS: Los Angeles stars are more famous than Eric Christian Olsen, there still are loads of fans who adored him and his character. Of course, aside from Olsen portraying Detective Marty Deeks, he is an actor with <a href=#>a long-time wife</a> and a career that has been going steady for even longer.</p><p>Looking back on Olsen's career, it is truly impressive that he has managed to find consistent work as an actor for so many years. Sadly, however, some of Olsen's projects have been stinkers and one of them even got him nominated for one of Hollywood's most humiliating awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-eric-christian-olsen-was-nominated-for-a-humiliating-award>Why Eric Christian Olsen Was Nominated For A Humiliating Award</h2><p>Long before Eric Christian Olsen was hired to appear in NCIS: Los Angeles and then became a member of the show's main cast in the second season, he was a young actor looking for work. During the early 2000s, Olsen landed roles in several projects that are still memorable today.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Has Leaving 'NCIS Los Angeles' Affected Renée Felice Smith's Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>During the first half of the 2000s, Olsen appeared in movies like Pearl Harbour, Not Another Teen Movie, and The Hot Chick among others. Also during the same timeframe, Olsen popped up in shows like Smallville and 24.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/not-another-teen-movie-cast.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering that Olsen landed roles in some truly memorable projects during that phase in his career, Olsen clearly had a lot to be proud of at the time. Sadly, however, Olsen also was hired to star in a movie that virtually everyone seemed to hate during that time in his career.</p><p>In 2003, a comedy prequel that mercifully few people saw was released that was titled Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd. The follow-up to one of the most popular comedies of the era and arguably of all time, Dumb and Dumber, Olsen's film had a lot to live up to.</p><p>In Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd, Olsen was cast as Lloyd Christmas. As a result, that meant that Olsen took over playing a character that Jim Carrey originated.</p><p>As Olsen has proven in a long list of roles, he has great comedy timing, and he is a talented actor. That said, Carrey is such a singular talent that no matter how funny and talented an actor is, they are going to struggle if they wind up in Jim's shadow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Every 2010s Movie That Won A Razzie For Worst Movie</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately for Olsen and everyone else involved in Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd, moviegoers had a long list of other complaints about the film.</p><p>Ever since the early-'80s, the Golden Raspberry awards, which are often called the Razzies, have been given out to celebrate the worst in film. On some rare occasions, recipients of the Razzie awards have shown up at the ceremony to accept their trophies, but almost everyone in Hollywood wants nothing to do with the Razzies.</p><p>Since most people who saw Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd had complaints, it wasn't overly surprising when the movie got nominated for three Razzie awards. The first two categories that Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd was nominated for were Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Screenplay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/eric-christian-olsen-and-derek-richardson.jpg><p>Sadly for Olsen, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was nominated for the Razzie Award for Worst Screen Couple</a> alongside Derek Richardson, the actor who took over portraying Harry Dunne. Even though most people don't consider Jeff Daniels to be a comedy legend like Carrey, he still did such a wonderful job playing Harry that it was shocking for anyone else to take on that role.</p><p>In the end, Olsen and Richardson didn't win the Razzie Award for Worst Screen Couple. Instead, that dubious honor went to Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez for their work in the movie Gigli.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/eric-christian-olsen-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It also is worth noting that Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd lost the other categories it was nominated for. Instead, Gigli won the Razzie for Worst Screenplay, and Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed took home the trophy for Worst Remake or Sequel.</p><h2 id=another-ncis-los-angeles-has-a-history-with-the-razzie-awards>Another NCIS: Los Angeles Has A History With The Razzie Awards</h2><p>Ever since Eric Christian Olsen joined the cast of NCIS: Los Angeles, he has co-starred with Chris O'Donnell. Just like Olsen, O'Donnell deserves to look back on his career with a great deal of pride. Sadly for O'Donnell, however, he also has a history with the Razzie Awards.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why ‘Batman And Robin’ Was Such A Bad Movie, According To Critics</a></span></p><p>In 1997, O'Donnell was one of Batman & Robin's main stars due to his titular role as the Caped Crusader's trusty sidekick. Widely considered to be one of the worst movies of all time, Batman & Robin is so bad that its director and main star, George Clooney, have both apologized for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/batman-robin-cast.jpg><p>Unsurprisingly, Batman & Robin won a Razzie Award because Alicia Silverstone prevailed in the Worst Supporting Actress category.</p><p>Unfortunately for O'Donnell, he was nominated for Worst Supporting Actor, although he didn't win as Dennis Rodman was chosen for that award in 1997.</p><p>Some of the other Razzie Batman & Robin was nominated for include Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screen Couple, Worst Remake or Sequel, and Worst Screenplay. Perhaps most laughably at all, Batman & Robin also was nominated for Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To O'Donnell's eternal credit, he didn't let all the ridicule Batman & Robin was subject to stop him from enjoying continued success as an actor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXaOwqr%2BMpaasZZGjtKa4xKxknqqZmHqktNGiqq2hkaN6sLjSnqVmpp%2Bitq%2Bt056bZp2dl66zvsCsqqKml2K1sLjLsq6op5Rirrit0Z2qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
