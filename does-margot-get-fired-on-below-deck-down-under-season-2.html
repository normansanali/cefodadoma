Deckhand Adam Kodra was let go this week after Captain Jason had safety concerns following an anchoring mishap."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This week, she finished a glass of red wine that she wanted to try after dinner service.</p><p>In the<a href=#> mid-season trailer, </a>Captain Jason was seen giving Margot a stern talking to about drinking when charter guests are on the luxury yacht. That, complied with all of the scenes of Margot drinking, certainly makes it seem like producers are setting the stage for her firing.</p><p>Captain Jason has a no-tolerance policy for drinking on charter. During Season 1 of the Below Deck Down Under, Culver Bradbury got a lecture from the captain, who told him it’s a fireable offense.</p><p>Culver didn’t get fired, but that doesn’t mean Margot won’t be the next one leaving the Northern Sun. Only a handful of episodes remain in the season, so Margot’s drinking should be addressed soon.</p><p>It’s been a wild ride for Margot during her first Below Deck Down Under stint.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-margot-sisson-s-below-deck-down-under-experience>Margot Sisson’s Below Deck Down Under experience</h2><p>The stew faced a near sexual assault by Luke, which, thankfully, producers and an overprotective <a href=#>Aesha Scott </a>prevented. Margot had to deal with Laura, showing her no sympathy and standing up for Luke.</p><p>After<a href=#> Laura and Luke were fired</a>, Margot was forced to deal with her relationship with Harry Van Vliet. The deckhand had a massive crush on her, but Margot friend-zoned him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>As <a href=#>Monsters and Critics previously reported,</a> Margot shared a heartfelt message to Harry spilling just how important his friendship is to her.</p><p>This week, Margot had to say goodbye to her goodbye pal Adam Kodra after Captain Jason Chambers fired him for an anchor incident. Margot recently revealed<a href=#> the emotional send-off with Adam and the crew that </a>Below Deck Down Under fans didn’t see.</p><p>Season 2 of <a href=#>Below Deck Down Unde</a>r is almost here because Bravo revealed details on Below Deck Med Season 8. You can check those out, including the trailer, right <a href=#>here.</a></p><p>Below Deck Down Under airs Mondays at 8/7c on Bravo. Season 1 is streaming on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5SksrR5zJqpoKekYrSmwIyfoKudlGK8r3nBnqOor12ZsqS3jJ2msKZdqrulsdFmqp6Zo6S7bn6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
