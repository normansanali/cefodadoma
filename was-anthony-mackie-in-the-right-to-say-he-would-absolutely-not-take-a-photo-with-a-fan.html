Children don’t differentiate between the actor and the character the way adults do…er…should, and it’s not unheard of for a child to excitedly go up to their favorite celebrity and ask for a picture or a video. In most cases, it’s a sweet moment of adoration, and a core memory is made with a quick smile and snap of a picture.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>So when a video of Mackie saying no to a fan asking for a photo went public, mixed feelings flooded the comments and retweet section of X (formerly Twitter). The post saw Mackie speaking to a woman who was asking for a photo and was told no.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>While polite, he did decline the picture, but a few things were immediately apparent: someone was recording without his knowledge or permission, and he was in some type of social situation — he wasn’t in a space to meet fans.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anthony Mackie politely declined… If he does not want to give a picture, respect that…. I don't care if the man is playing Big Bird; if he wishes to be left alone, leave him be. <a href=#>https://t.co/dpeaOPTm45</a></p>— 𝙅𝙤𝙝𝙣 𝘿𝙤𝙩𝙨𝙤𝙣 (@JohnMovieWatch) <a href=#>October 2, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>Despite being a public figure with a position that draws in children and adults, he isn’t required to take a picture just because he’s asked. One of the most fundamental life rules that we’re taught, even as children, is that no means no, and we’re not entitled to the space that someone else is existing in just because we’d like to be.</p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=203 data-injectable=false>For many fans, it would feel like a dream to stumble upon Mackie at some social event, but a hello and a slight wave or nod of the head might have made the encounter more memorable for everyone involved.</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>Evans, the MCU’s first Captain America, shared that he’s always struggled with the idea of being famous and that red-carpet events would give him severe anxiety; it almost&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ended his career</a>&nbsp;before it took flight. Even though actors and actresses go into roles knowing people will likely recognize them as such, it doesn’t mean that the road is always easy for them.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Chris Evans was just talking about largely abandoning Hollywood to wear cozy sweaters and sip pumpkin spice lattes and y'all are surprised Anthony Mackie doesn't want to sign autographs and take pics while he's out and about? Celebrities are not your 24/7 on demand entertainment!</p>— Brandon Lewis (@blewis1103) <a href=#>October 2, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>We’re not putting a diagnosis of anxiety onto Mackie; in fact — we’re not sure why he said no in the first place, but it’s important to remember that celebrities are just people with a job in the public realm; they’re no different than we are on a fundamental level.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=475 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>This means they’ll have days when they’re “on,” days when they’re feeling a little blue, and during periods when they’re “off the clock,” they’ll likely want to take full advantage of that. When you clock off at the end of the day, you won’t answer every work-related call or message until your next shift — unless you know something big is on the horizon or you’ve offered to make yourself available.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anthony Mackie reminds me of me. Don't ask me for shit when I'm off the clock.</p>— Alien Ninja Star (@OverACheatah) <a href=#>October 2, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=704 data-current-count=1004 data-injectable=true>Mackie might have been existing in a public space, but he wasn’t there as Captain America; it wasn’t a Marvel event, and he didn’t say “no” and storm off like some mega-diva; in fact, when an account on Instagram shared more of a backstory into the situation with Mackie, many took the actor’s side. The tweets highlighting the stories posted by the woman involved have since been deleted, but they can be summarized as this: a woman approached Mackie and was told that he wouldn’t take a picture with her son. She shared the news with someone attending the event with her, and that person decided to take the child over to Mackie to see if he would reconsider.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://twitter.com/neworleanspulse/status/1708871152184205480?s=61&t=8kmAYFTyemYKT11eKzSmQQ</figure><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true>That’s right; the video shared comes during the second attempt of Mackie being asked to take a photo; the recording wasn’t made with his permission, and the people involved told the children who was in the VIP area of the event they were part of, the kids didn’t notice Mackie or recognize him until it was brought to their attention.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>When the boy went over recording on his phone, he was likely excited — we’re not taking that away from him at all. As we said above, it’s a great feeling to be sharing space with someone you admire, but Mackie had already delivered a no to taking a photo, and it wasn’t fair to try to change his mind by changing the company of who was involved in the ask.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anthony Mackie did not want to be there signing autographs for the next two hours.

Mackie is a person, and who knows if, after one photo opp, many requests wouldn’t have immediately followed?</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>While he didn’t owe anyone an explanation, this tweet offers one; he might have something in a clause that says he can’t take photos with minors with a drink or cigar in his hand.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>(it should also be noted he may have something in his contract where he can't be photographed with alcohol in his hand, especially with kids) <a href=#>https://t.co/D68g1uBbhi</a></p>— Your Fave's Fave 🇵🇷 (@_ItsMarisWorld_) <a href=#>October 2, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>In addition to politely declining the photo, he does thank the woman and remains kind throughout the interaction, even though his first “no” wasn’t respected.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>no celebrity, including anthony mackie, is required to take a picture with you. he politely said no, and thanked the woman. maybe not the desired outcome, but it is what it is</p>— Candice Frederick (@ReelTalker) <a href=#>October 2, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>All in all, it’s important to remember that celebrities are just like us, and despite a slew of public attention being pointed in Mackie’s direction right now, he’s not wrong for wanting to enjoy an event without the added pressure of being a public figure at one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEor%2BMmqWtoJ%2Bjxm65wJyiop1dnrtuwMeeZKuhl53BbsDOZqqasV2dsm7Dzq6jnWWRl8CwuNStnKWxXaO8tXnTmqKeZZFivam706hksKGknXqiecWapWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
