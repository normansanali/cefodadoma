The former teen pop star, who announced she’s calling it quits on her nearly six-year marriage to the musician last month, stepped out in L.A.’s Los Feliz nabe, on Monday, Feb. 16, without her sparkler while running errands.</p><p>Wearing jeans and a simple white T-shirt, the Red Band Society actress, 30, looked refreshed after spending Valentine’s Day weekend on a retreat with BFF <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Minka Kelly</a></strong>.</p><p>The two pals took to Instagram to document their girls’ weekend at swanky <a href=# data-link=1>detox</a> camp The Ranch at Live Oak Malibu. On Thursday, Feb. 12, newly single Moore shared a makeup-free selfie with Kelly, 34, kicking off their weekend getaway. “Getting ready for hike #1 and staying hydrated w @minkak and @theranchmalibu. #herewego #sortascaredbutmostlyexcited cc: @muscularcalves,” she captioned the post.</p><p>The following day, the “Candy” singer shared a group shot with her hiking crew and the caption, “Our crew, pre-hike. Feeling gratitude for time spent with such a lovely group of new friends. @theranchmalibu @minkak #legsareprettytiredthough #theranch4.0.”&nbsp;</p><p>On actual Valentine’s Day, Moore and Kelly leaned on each other — literally. “We got separated from the rest of the group but we surrendered to a different path up and through these mountains and it was worth it. So lucky to share this time with you @minkak! You’re a total bad-ass and inspiration. #celebratingfriendship #10milehike #calvesarekillingme,” she captioned a scenic photo of herself and Kelly sitting on a bench overlooking the ocean view. Kelly, for her part, has been linked to Chris Evans on and off since 2007.</p><p>Moore revealed the hike and retreat left her <a href=# rel=noopener>“feeling so empowered and ready to take on the world!”</a> — which was much needed. After all, the same day news broke of her split, she admitted she was going through the “worst” time.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In an Instagram photo of two signs which read “Mercury Retrograde” and “Proceed With Caution,” Moore wrote: “Message received. #thatexplainsit #theworst.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/138697716_Mandy-Moore-Ryan-Adams-467.jpg><p>Moore and Adams secretly said “I do” in March 2009. On Jan. 23 they <a href=# rel=noopener>revealed to <strong>Us</strong></a><strong> </strong>in a joint statement they were calling it quits. “Mandy Moore and Ryan Adams have mutually decided to end their marriage of almost 6 years,” the couple said in the statement. “It is a respectful, amicable parting of ways and both Mandy and Ryan are asking for media to respect their privacy at this time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammZ6Zxm65zqipnmWjqbKxv4yorK1lp57BqbvUrWSwnZSZtq%2BzjKugp59dlrO1sdFmm6Kun6ewpnnNnq6sZaCdvLW70mZpaWllZoRzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
