"I honestly think at the time when we first dated, I didn’t clearly love myself enough to think that I deserved to be with someone who was actually nice to me. And I was just wrapped up in this new get-out-of-jail-free card, L.A.-party lifestyle, whereas he had already kind of been there and done that, since he grew up in this industry.”</p><p>Burke added that she is “so grateful and happy” the pair reconnected and that “he’s the complete opposite of everything bad about my past relationships.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cheryl-burke-and-matthew-lawrence-39-s-divorce-details><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Cheryl Burke And Matthew Lawrence's Divorce Details</span></h2><p>TMZ announced that Cheryl Burke, 37, filed for divorce from Matthew Lawrence, 42, after three years of marriage. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to court documents obtained by US Weekly</a>, the DWTS pro submitted the paperwork on February 18, 2022, and the date of separation was listed at January 7, 2021.
