Annie doesn’t seem to care about money and has always enjoyed their ‘cheap dates’ more, which is very attractive to Steven.</p><p>The couple has inseparable chemistry and the audience belive the connection is genuine after Annie admitted she couldn’t believe that he was the millionaire, but still wanted to carry on pursuing him.</p><p>Amber also has a great connection with him but both have admitted to holding back throughout the season Despite this, Amber still has managed to stay at the forefront of Steven’s mind.</p><p>In terms of Cara, fans think the chance of her being picked is very little now as she is still confused about who she wants to pursue, even though we are down to the final six. Fans think Cara has left it too late and the same goes for Whitney.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Watching Joe Millionaire and if Steven doesn’t end up marrying Annie I’ll be sooo pissed.</p>— b.

The hometown visits are some of the most important dates on the show and the successful ones usually make it to the finale.</p><p>Steven had planned a wholesome day where the ladies spent time on his farm and even got to milk an adorable baby cow – which helped the ladies swoon over the hunky heartthrob just that little bit more.</p><p>Fans didn’t really think any of the girls stood out too much during the hometown visits but Amber seemed to fit in with the family the most. Natalie didn’t seem to enjoy farm life but she managed to keep this quiet and steven didn’t seem to notice. His family also said they thought Annie was “nice” and “genuine.”</p><p>Whitney and Calla didn’t seem to enjoy the visit too much and fans are almost certain that the final two ladies will be Amber and Annie, with the majority of viewers thinking Annie will be the winner.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by anniejorgensen (@anniejorgensen)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-big-twist-at-the-end-of-the-episode>The big twist at the end of the episode</h2><p>At the end of the episode, as usual, fans were expecting to say goodbye to at least one of the remaining six girls, but we were shocked when an elimination didn’t happen.</p><p>Instead, the girls and Steven and Kurt had a cocktail party that was interrupted at the end by the host, Martin, who revealed a big twist that next week, the women would have to choose which of the eligible bachelors they want to pursue.</p><p>This unexpected twist should help Steven’s decision between the ladies much easier as hopefully, he will see who is really into him and who isn’t.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH JOE MILLIONAIRE ON THURSDAYS AT 8/7C ON FOX</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON </strong><a href=#>INSTAGRAM </a><strong>AND </strong><a href=#>FACEBOOK</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xXZy8tL%2FIqWSappRiu6bD0midmqajYsGptc2kZK2gla56rLrOsGSwoJ9iwLWx1Z6lZq%2BZobluvMicomannmK3sLGMpqClpJmku6K10Z4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
