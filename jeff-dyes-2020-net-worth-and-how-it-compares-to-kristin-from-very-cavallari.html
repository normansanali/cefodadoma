As of October 2020, the podcast has 122 episodes. Jeff Dye’s Friendship has 1.47K subscribers on YouTube.</p><p>By the looks of things, Jeff’s a comedian in demand, therefore his net worth is likely to be pretty substantial. He’s very popular and across social media has around 200k subscribers and followers. In 2016, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Earn The Necklace</a> reported his net worth at <strong>$19m</strong>.</p><p>From a quick scan of his Instagram, Jeff seems like a pretty down to earth guy who enjoys hanging out with friends and family and going for rides with his pet dog.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jeff Dye (@jeffdye)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h3 class=wp-block-heading id=kristin-cavallaris-net-worth>Kristin Cavallari’s net worth</h3><p>Due to the romantic setting in which Kristin and Jeff were ‘spotted’, we can assume that they’re dating. So, let’s take a look at the Very Cavallari star’s earnings.</p><p>Kristin rose to fame a little earlier than Jeff after appearing on MTV show Laguna Beach in 2004 and The Hills in 2009. After some time away from the spotlight, she later was given her own TV show, Very Cavallari, which launched in 2018 and is still running today.</p><p>The 33-year-old has appeared in some small film and TV roles, however, her main successes have been Laguna Beach, The Hills and Very Cavallari. She’s also made many guest appearances on shows such as Ru Paul’s Drag Race, America’s Next Top Model and Cupcake Wars. Kirstin was also the presenter for reality TV show Paradise Hotel in 2019.</p><p>After a marriage that lasted almost a decade, Kristin divorced Jay Cutler in 2020. The former couple share three children. According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Style Caster</a>, her net worth is unlikely to be damaged even if she loses money from the divorce. Kirstin’s 2020 net worth is estimated at <strong>$30m</strong> as reported by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Compared to her new beau, Kristin looks to have a net worth $11m greater than Jeff.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kristin Cavallari (@kristincavallari)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>INSTAGRAM</a> AND <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfmnqmutOeqa2ZmaO6prrTaKGenpZisbqx0mZpaWpgYrumwIywpqusmGKur7CMoaawZZmpeqS7zKmYq52jYsGwecqroKysmaN6p77OpmSvnaKueqSt1ZqjpZming%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
